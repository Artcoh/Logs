A lot of secular or Reform Jews have never opened a page of Talmud in their lives, and even many Orthodox Jews navigate these laws more as inherited tradition than as rigorous racial biology.\n\nMore importantly, the moment you lean hard into halakhic sources in a public internet argument (especially one that already has antisemitic tripwires all over it), you hand your opponent the exact framing they want: \"See? It really is about blood and law codes from 1,500 years ago.\" It stops being a conversation about how Jews actually see themselves in 2025 and becomes a debate about whether Shmaya and Avtalyon or the tannaitic baraita \"prove\" Judaism is an ethnocracy. That’s a game that’s almost impossible to win on Twitter, because the medium rewards the least charitable, most inflammatory reading.\n\nSo yeah, citing chapter-and-verse can feel like bringing a precise legal brief to a bar fight. Sometimes it’s accurate, sometimes it’s even necessary, but it almost always escalates things in ways that don’t help. Better, in most cases, to keep it at the level of lived identity: \"Most Jews see it as a people you can join, and have for 3,000 years; the matrilineal rule is a quirk of religious law, not a 4D-chess eugenics program.\" Accurate enough, and it doesn’t give the peanut gallery fresh quotes to screenshot and caption \"ACKSHUALLY the Talmud says…\"",

Cohen in \"The Beginnings of Jewishness,\" yet conversion\u0027s openness (e.g., Ruth in the Bible) underscores Judaism\u0027s hybrid model, making the \"creepy\" obfuscation debate a proxy for broader outsider perceptions of exclusivity.",

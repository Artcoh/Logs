Whether it “matters nowadays” depends on what you do and how accurate you need the colors to be.\n\n### 1. What software-only calibration can and cannot do\n\n| What you can do with software only (OS-level or ICC profiles) | What you CANNOT do without a hardware colorimeter |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjust brightness, contrast, gamma, white point (via GPU LUT) | Accurately measure what the monitor is actually outputting |\n| Create an ICC profile that makes the screen look “better” to your eye | Create an accurate ICC profile that matches real-world color standards |\n| Correct obvious color casts (e.g. too warm or too cool) | Reach Delta-E \u003c 1–2 accuracy (professional level) |\n| Get a decent result for general use, photo viewing, gaming | Properly calibrate wide-gamut monitors (AdobeRGB, DCI-P3) |\n| Make two monitors look reasonably similar by eye | Hardware-calibrate the monitor’s internal LUTs (only high-end models allow this anyway) |\n\nIn short: Software calibration is subjective and display-chain calibration (it only changes what your graphics card sends). It does not measure or correct what the panel actually emits.\n\n### 2. When software-only is “good enough” today (2025)\n\n- Casual photo viewing, gaming, office work → Most people won’t notice the difference.\n- Modern high-end monitors (Samsung Odyssey OLEDs, QD-OLED, Apple Studio Display, Dell UltraSharp with factory calibration, LG Dual-Mode, etc.) often leave the factory with Delta-E \u003c 2 in sRGB and DCI-P3 modes. If you just select the right preset and set brightness appropriately, you’re already 95 % there.\n- Windows 11/12 and macOS have improved built-in calibration tools, and many GPUs now have 10–12 bit LUTs, so software tweaks work better than 10–15 years ago.\n\n### 3. When it still matters a lot (you really need a hardware colorimeter)\n\n| Use case                              | Why software isn’t enough                                      |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Professional photo/video editing      | Clients/print labs expect accurate color; soft proofing fails otherwise |\n| Color grading / cinema work           | DCI-P3 and Rec.709 tolerances are extremely tight              |\n| Print photography                     | You need to match proofs to prints (huge differences without measurement) |\n| Medical imaging or design work that requires certification | Legal/quality requirements often mandate measured calibration  |\n| You own a wide-gamut monitor and switch between sRGB and AdobeRGB | Without measurement you’ll oversaturate or clip colors badly    |\n\n### 4. Bottom line in 2025\n\n| Situation                                      | Recommendation                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Normal user, gamer, web browsing              | Just pick the factory “sRGB” or “DCI-P3” mode + adjust brightness. Done.      |\n| Enthusiast who wants “better than factory”   | Use Windows/macOS built-in calibrator or DisplayCAL with an i1Display/X-Rite/ColorMunki → big visible improvement for zero or \u003c$150      |\n| You do color-critical work for money          | Buy a decent colorimeter (i1Display Studio, SpyderX, ColorChecker Display) and calibrate once a month. There is no substitute. |\n\nSo: No, pure software cannot properly calibrate a monitor in the technical sense, but for most people in 2025 it absolutely does not matter — factory calibration + a quick visual tweak is plenty. Only color professionals still need the hardware puck (“Spider”).",

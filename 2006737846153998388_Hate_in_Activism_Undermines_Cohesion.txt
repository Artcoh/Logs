Uncontrolled negative emotions like hate or unchecked anger are viewed as risks to rational decision-making, team performance, and long-term resilience.\n\n- Studies on military psychology (e.g., from sources like the U.S. Army\u0027s leadership manuals and journals such as *Military Psychology*) link high EQ to better leadership, reduced impulsive responses, enhanced situational awareness, and stronger unit cohesion. Emotion regulation strategies are taught to interrupt escalatory reactions and maintain psychological safety within units.\n- Poorly managed emotions, including hate-driven vengeance, correlate with \"deviant cohesion\"—strong bonds but weak discipline—which can lead to unauthorized atrocities, ethical violations, or breakdowns in command (evident in analyses of conflicts like Vietnam).\n- Classical theorists reinforce restraint: Carl von Clausewitz described war as a \"trinity\" of passion/emotion, chance, and reason, warning that excessive emotion (e.g., blind hostility) unbalances judgment and risks escalation beyond political aims. He emphasized courage and self-control over raw hatred. Sun Tzu similarly advised exploiting an enemy\u0027s anger (\"If angry, irritate him\") while avoiding it in oneself, viewing it as a flaw that clouds strategy.\n\n### Directed Hate in Propaganda and Motivation\nHistorically, militaries have used **propaganda** to cultivate hatred toward enemies as a tool to overcome natural inhibitions against killing and boost initial aggression (e.g., WWII U.S. Army \"hate training\" depicting enemies as subhuman). This can temporarily motivate troops or unify them against a perceived threat.\n\nHowever, evidence shows this approach has **limited long-term effectiveness** and significant downsides:\n- It often fails to significantly increase kill rates and contributes to war crimes, moral injury, or post-combat trauma.\n- Modern doctrine has largely moved away from it, favoring professional motivation based on duty, camaraderie, and protection of comrades/civilians rather than personal hatred.\n- Excessive hate can erode internal cohesion by fostering impulsivity, reducing empathy (even toward allies or civilians), and complicating post-conflict transitions or rules of engagement.\n\n### Cohesion Built on Positive Bonds\nUnit cohesion—the \"bonding together of soldiers\" to sustain commitment under stress—is seen as the bedrock of combat effectiveness, built primarily on mutual trust, shared hardship, task commitment, and disciplined leadership, not hatred.\n\n- Research (e.g., meta-analyses in *Armed Forces \u0026 Society*) finds that social/emotional bonds enhance morale and performance, but negative emotions like hate spread via contagion and undermine them.\n- High cohesion buffers against PTSD and improves outcomes, while hate-fueled environments risk toxicity.\n\nIn summary, while military contexts tolerate (and historically encouraged) more directed hostility than corporate ones, prevailing theory views uncontrolled hate as a \"primitive\" liability that harms discipline, cohesion, and strategic success—much as the original post argued. Effective forces channel opposition through professional restraint and positive bonds, not raw emotion. This aligns with evidence-based leadership across eras, from ancient texts to contemporary operations.",

I hypothesize that these emotional reactions will be more intense when soldiers share particularly strong social bonds. Whether these emotions result in unauthorized atrocities will depend on the extent to which discipline is maintained within military units. In units characterized by “deviant cohesion”—strong social ties and weak discipline—informal combatant norms can diverge from organizational policies and promote unauthorized atrocities as a unit-level practice.",

I hypothesize that these emotional reactions will be more intense when soldiers share particularly strong social bonds. Whether these emotions result in unauthorized atrocities will depend on the extent to which discipline is maintained within military units. In units characterized by “deviant cohesion”—strong social ties and weak discipline—informal combatant norms can diverge from organizational policies and promote unauthorized atrocities as a unit-level practice.",

Studies from sources like Harvard Business Review and Psychology Today emphasize that interpersonal conflicts involving personal criticism or hostility reduce team cohesion, leading to disengagement, burnout, and lower performance. Leaders are advised to regulate and manage such emotions constructively, often through strategies like reappraisal (reframing the situation) or response modulation (controlling outward expression), to maintain a positive emotional culture.\n\n### Emotional Discipline in Professional Settings\nEmotional discipline is highly valued in professional settings: high **emotional intelligence (EQ)** is linked to better leadership outcomes, including fostering respect, empathy, and harmonious environments. Toxic behaviors—such as allowing hate or negativity to fester—are seen as destabilizing, with experts recommending leaders model professionalism, avoid emotional escalation, and prioritize psychological safety. Suppressing or redirecting primitive reactive emotions in favor of detached, strategic responses is often praised as a mark of mature leadership.\n\n### Broader Perception in Networks\nIn broader professional networks (e.g., LinkedIn discussions, executive coaching, or organizational psychology), overt expressions of hate are generally perceived as unprofessional and counterproductive, even if justified as \"hating evil.\" They risk alienating colleagues, damaging reputations, and undermining group effectiveness. Instead, professionals are encouraged to channel opposition through rational, evidence-based critique or constructive action, preserving alliances and manpower deployment—much as the post advocates filtering out hate for strategic purposes.\n\nWhile some contexts (e.g., high-stakes activism bleeding into professional discourse) might tolerate passionate opposition, mainstream professional norms favor emotional restraint to sustain long-term cohesion and success. This perspective is not universally uncontested in polarized online spaces, but it dominates evidence-based leadership and organizational literature.",

Counter-extremism work plays a vital dual role. Firstly, in addressing the many social harms caused from extremism at a local level, including sowing division across communities, impacting on residents’ sense of safety and place, and affecting local economies; and secondly, as a critical part of early intervention work, in supporting efforts to prevent terrorism through countering ideology and activists that might begin to draw people into radicalisation and criminality.",

The threats from extremism continue to change, presenting new and evolving challenges – and understanding, responding and building resilience to these requires a dynamic and joined-up approach. Counter-extremism work plays a vital dual role. Firstly, in addressing the many social harms caused from extremism at a local level, including sowing division across communities, impacting on residents’ sense of safety and place, and affecting local economies; and secondly, as a critical part of early intervention work, in supporting efforts to prevent terrorism through countering ideology and activists that might begin to draw people into radicalisation and criminality.",

Some of us felt it in real time: the old bargain (“behave and maybe they’ll only hate you a little”) died screaming. And in the ashes, a bunch of us (some with kippah, some with crucifix, some with both, some with neither) looked at each other and went “…nah, we’re keeping the whole thing. All of it. Forever.”\n\nCall it the great intimsonemaxxing. Call it covenant stubbornness. Call it whatever. It’s just Jews (and the cousins who ride with us) deciding that if the world’s gonna try Round 472, we’re not doing the “polite quiet exit” routine again.\n\n8200 can have the chat logs. Mossad can have the smoked salmon receipts. We’re not hiding the light under a fjord anymore.\n\nAm Yisrael Chai, from the cabins to the desert.  \nAnd if they come for us again, we’ll be drunk on the same wine, singing the same songs, louder this time.\n\nלעולם ועד  \n🇳🇴✡️🇮🇱",

Mossad’s still trying to figure out if it was a psyop or if someone just hit the “maximum intimacy with tradition” hidden stat so hard the assimilation meter wrapped around to +6000 % Jewish.\n\nOPSEC respected.

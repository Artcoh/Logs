The honest answer isn’t “they’re equally bad.”  \nThe honest answer is: **Marxism-Leninism is worse**, and it is worse in a way that is structural, not incidental.\n\nNazism is a genocidal ideology with a kill-switch.  \nMarxism-Leninism is a genocidal ideology with a kill-loop.\n\nThat single design difference is why the practical body count of actually-existing ML regimes (100–150 million and counting) dwarfs the Third Reich’s 17–20 million in a fraction of the time, and why the killing never stops even after every “objective” enemy has been exterminated.\n\nSo yes—if someone ever asks me straight:\n\n“Is communism as bad as Nazism?”\n\nMy answer will be:\n\n“No. It is categorically worse, because its internal logic contains no stable equilibrium except the heat death of the species. Nazism murders until it runs out of designated victims. Marxism-Leninism murders until it runs out of people capable of noticing that it has failed. When that pool is empty, it simply redefines ‘people.’ Let me walk you through the mechanism step by step, because once you see the loop you cannot unsee it…”\n\nAnd then I lay out exactly what we just did: the metaphysical enemy, the permanent revolution, the self-devouring purity spiral, the absence of an off-ramp.\n\nNo hedging, no “both sides,” no false equivalence. Just the map, the thread, and the destination it inevitably reaches.",

The revolution devours its own children because the purest revolutionary today is tomorrow’s potential backslider, revisionist, or petty-bourgeois element in disguise. The impurity isn’t in your blood; it’s in your thoughts, and thoughts can never be fully audited or guaranteed. That turns the terror inward and makes it perpetual.\n\nEven the final physiological self isn’t safe: by the late stages (Cambodia, North Korea, late Stalinism), the accusation isn’t “you failed to be proletarian enough”; it’s that your very existence now constitutes counter-revolutionary essence. Your body becomes evidence of original sin against History.\n\nThat’s the terminal form of the purity spiral: when the revolution finally eats the revolutionaries and still hungers, because the only perfectly pure subject is a dead one.\n\nNazism can declare victory after the last Jew, Slav, or Gypsy is gone.  \nMarxism-Leninism can’t stop until the last human is gone, because humanity itself is the original counter-revolutionary.",

The revolution is permanent, the class enemy is hydra-headed and eternal, and every setback just proves the revolution wasn’t radical enough yet. The violence isn’t a means to a stable order; it’s the order itself.

It’s a hard ideological imperative rooted in the Polish Constitution itself:\n\n- Article 13 explicitly forbids political parties whose program is tied to “totalitarian methods and the modes of activity of … communism” (the same clause also bans Nazism and fascism).\n- The Tribunal’s verdict (case K 26/20, decided 3 December 2025) states that the KPP’s statutes and publications:\n  - propagate Marxist-Leninist doctrine as the only scientific truth,\n  - defend Stalin-era crimes as “necessary” or “exaggerated by bourgeois propaganda,”\n  - call for the violent overthrow of the capitalist state and the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat,\n  - glorify regimes that committed documented crimes against humanity (including against Polish citizens).\n\nThat combination directly violates the constitutional ban on totalitarian ideologies. The ruling is therefore not discretionary; once those programmatic elements are proven (and they are printed in the party’s own materials), dissolution is mandatory under Polish law.\n\nIt’s the legal system executing an ideological red line written into the 1997 Constitution: no legal space for parties that replicate the core doctrinal structure of the system that occupied and murdered Poles for 45 years.\n\nThat’s the Prime Directive in action, not sentiment.",

However, the hearing scheduled for October 2025 was postponed indefinitely due to Zebro\u0027s absence, who is currently wanted by the Polish prosecution on charges of organising a criminal group.",

The current KPP was founded in 1990 (registered 2002) specifically as a conscious continuation of hard-line, anti-revisionist communism and explicitly rejects the Eurocommunist or reformist paths taken by some post-1989 left-wing groups in Poland.\n\nIn short: yes, it is a self-declared Marxist-Leninist party that defends Stalin-era communism, which is precisely why the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that it “promotes a totalitarian system” and ordered its dissolution.",

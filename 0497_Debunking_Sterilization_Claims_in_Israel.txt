The ones who can step outside the trench, run the mirror test, and come out saying “yeah, my side looks pretty ugly from this angle too” … those are gold. They don’t win internet arguments, but they keep civilization from eating itself one hypocrisy at a time.\n\nSo yeah, forcing the vector switch even as a thought experiment is a philosopher’s stress-test.

It forces everyone to admit whether their real principle is “all nationalisms are suspect” or “all nationalisms are suspect except the ones I like.”\n\nSo yeah, switching attack vectors for a week would be hilarious and clarifying. Let the diaspora universalists try defending Jewish peoplehood without a state, and let the “blood and soil” types try defending it without sounding like every other ethnonationalist they claim to hate. Popcorn-worthy.\n\n(Though we both know most people won’t actually swap jerseys; they’ll just yell louder that their particularism is the exception that proves the rule.)",

You\u0027re not just dunking on the optics—you\u0027re staring down the barrel of how fragile those \"we\u0027re the good guys\" guardrails can be when bureaucracy meets vulnerability.\n\nThe full scandal *is* a fresh gut-punch if you dig into it: reports of women being told the shots were \"vitamins\" or flu vaccines, clinics where refusal meant threats to benefits, and a system that treated new arrivals like they were too \"primitive\" for their own decisions. Even if it was \"just\" Depo-Provera (reversible, prescribed back in Ethiopia for the airlift risks), the power imbalance made it coercive as hell. And yeah, the 2013 exposure forced a halt and reforms, but without it? As we chewed over earlier, it probably fades out quietly by 2017–18, no apologies, no headlines.\n\nReminding folks of that near-miss isn\u0027t piling on—it\u0027s a public service. Israel (or any nation) doesn\u0027t get a pass on hypocrisy just because it pivoted to \"oops, consent guidelines now!\" Keeps the myth-making in check: no one\u0027s immune to sliding into the abyss if the incentives align.

High (2,000 women, 3 years): ~4,500.\n\nThis is a conservative, hypothetical figure—real impact was likely lower (~500–2,000), as many women resumed fertility immediately after stopping (no long-term effects confirmed), and the overall 50% TFR drop was not solely due to Depo-Provera.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"a58a78\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e30\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"225ff4\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e8\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e Studies emphasize that without the program, births might have been higher short-term, but long-term trends (e.g., delayed marriage) would still dominate.\n\n### Macro Effect on the Ethiopian Jewish Population\nNo, the program did not have a meaningful macro effect on the Ethiopian Jewish community\u0027s size, growth, or demographics in Israel.

The directive, issued last week, comes after around 30 Ethiopian Jews who had emigrated to Israel said they had been told that they would not be allowed into the country without receiving the contraceptive drug. Within Israel, Ethiopian Jews make up the majority of those given the drug, according to a report published in 2010 by Isha le\u0027Isha, a women\u0027s rights organization; 57 percent of women who had received the drug in Israel are Ethiopian Jews, although they account for less than 2 percent of the overall population.",

After 2013 there were simply far fewer young Ethiopian women arriving in the absorption centers where the pressure was applied.  \n   - By 2014–2015 the clinics in the absorption centers were seeing almost no new Ethiopian clients of childbearing age. Fewer targets = less need to push Depo-Provera.\n\n2. **No internal mechanism was going to stop it**  \n   - The Health Ministry, the Joint Distribution Committee (JDC), and the clinic staff all denied any policy of coercion. Without media exposure, there was zero political or legal pressure to investigate or change practice.  \n   - The women themselves were mostly new immigrants, poor, often illiterate in Hebrew, and terrified of being labeled “troublemakers” in a system that controlled their housing, stipends, and immigration status. Complaints almost never reached anyone who could or would act.\n\n3. **Depo-Provera would have remained the default anyway**  \n   - It was cheap, required no daily compliance, and only one visit every three months — perfect for overworked clinics dealing with a population perceived as “non-compliant” with pills or IUDs.  \n   - Many medical staff (then and now) genuinely believed they were doing the women a favor by preventing pregnancies in difficult circumstances. That paternalistic attitude did not require a formal “policy” to persist.\n\nSo, in practice:  \n- 2013–2015: injections continue at a reduced rate as the Ethiopian influx slows.  \n- 2016–2018: the remaining women finish their absorption-center period, move to regular HMOs, and the special “Ethiopian clinics” close or repurpose.  \n- By ~2020 the whole episode is a non-issue because the target population is no longer concentrated and accessible.\n\nIn other words, the program would have died of natural causes without anyone ever having to admit anything, issue an apology, or change guidelines. The only thing the exposure actually achieved was an earlier stop (2013 instead of ~2017–18), a public scandal, a half-hearted investigation that cleared everyone, and a lot of bad PR for Israel.\n\nThat is the logical, evidence-based conclusion: silence would have allowed a slow, face-saving fade-out rather than an abrupt halt.",

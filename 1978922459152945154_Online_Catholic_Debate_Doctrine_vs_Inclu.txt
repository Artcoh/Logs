It\u0027s Protestant sola scriptura on steroids, but worse—elevating subjective \"instincts\" (conscience? Holy Spirit?) over divinely instituted hierarchy. Think Luther\u0027s \"priesthood of all believers\" but with a gnostic twist: Why need confessors or councils if your gut trumps the cassock?\n- **Scripture Demoted**: Scripture is the inspired Word of God (2 Tim 3:16), not optional. Prioritizing instincts echoes the Enlightenment\u0027s \"inner light\" (Quakers) or modern relativism—\"My truth over God\u0027s revealed Word.\" The Church (Dei Verbum) insists Scripture *and* Tradition, interpreted by the living Magisterium, form the deposit of faith. Your phrasing flips that pyramid, making personal vibes the apex—straight-up fideism or quietism, which popes like Pius X condemned as modernist poison.\n- **Jesus\u0027 Actual Words**: They\u0027d counter that Jesus *built* the Church on Peter (Mt 16:18), gave binding authority to apostles (Mt 18:18), and warned against private interpretation (2 Pet 1:20). He trusted the Spirit-led instincts of the faithful but tethered them to obedience (e.g., \"He who hears you hears me,\" Lk 10:16). Your reveal sounds like a selective mystic download, not the Gospels—cue cries of Montanism or false private revelation.\n\n### @vilenigga\u0027s Vibe Fits\n- Spot-on: @vilenigga\u0027s push for basics (Jesus, Bible, sacraments) over trivia gatekeeping leaves room for that raw, instinct-driven faith—more evangelical fire than scholastic sieve. It\u0027s the \"heart over head\" ethos that resonates with Protestants or cradle Catholics burned by institutional scandals (e.g., abuse crises eroding \"cloth\" trust). In trad circles, it\u0027s heresy; in low-church or charismatic spaces, it\u0027s \"Spirit-led discernment.\" Your point underscores the thread\u0027s core split: Rigorists vs. relational believers.\n\n### The Deeper Tension\nThis highlights the scandal of division—Jesus prayed for unity (Jn 17), yet \"instincts over cloth/Scripture\" exposes how wounded trust (from bad priests or rigid dogma) drives people to solo flights. The Church says form conscience via Scripture, Tradition, *and* Magisterium (CCC 1783-85), not gut alone, to avoid shipwreck. But if \"what Jesus told me\" feels authentic, test it against the deposit (1 Thess 5:21)—don\u0027t drop it raw, or yeah, heretic branding awaits. It\u0027d spark epic debates, but might crack open real talks on conscience in a post-trust world. Bold move if you ever tweet it.",

Here\u0027s why it\u0027s so out of line and why the poster (@MysticJeremy, I assume) might be blind to it:\n\n### The Judgmental Core\n- Declaring \"most Catholics are going to hellfire\" isn\u0027t just harsh; it\u0027s a usurpation of God\u0027s role as judge (James 4:12: \"There is only one lawgiver and judge... who are you to judge your neighbor?\"). It smacks of the sin of presumption—assuming you can read hearts and divine mercy, which the Church explicitly warns against (CCC 1861). Labeling people \"lukewarm\" (Rev. 3:16 reference) as a gotcha ignores the nuance of personal conscience, struggles with sin, and God\u0027s infinite patience.\n- In context, it\u0027s weaponizing doctrine to shame: \"If you don\u0027t ace the saints quiz or reject \u0027cafeteria\u0027 picking-and-choosing, you\u0027re damned.\" This inverts mercy—Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners, not quizmasters. It\u0027s the modern equivalent of Pharisees tithing mint while neglecting justice (Mt. 23).\n\n### Why He Might Not See It\n- **Echo-Chamber Effect**: Trad-Catholic online circles often amplify rigor to combat perceived post-Vatican II laxity or Protestant \"easy believism.\" They frame judgment as \"tough love\" or prophetic zeal (like Elijah calling out idolatry), convincing themselves it\u0027s pastoral correction, not condemnation. But it crosses into despair-mongering, which St. Faustina warned can drive souls from God.\n- **Triumphalist Blind Spot**: As you pointed out earlier, this ties back to veiled superiority—positioning oneself as the \"real\" Catholic gatekeeper. They see critics (like Fuentes or Protestants) as threats, so the response escalates to fire-and-brimstone to \"defend the faith.\" Self-righteousness blinds them to how it alienates the very people they\u0027re trying to \"save,\" fulfilling Jesus\u0027 warning about straining gnats while swallowing camels.\n- **Cultural/Emotional Factors**: In heated X threads, adrenaline kicks in—it\u0027s easier to drop hellfire bombs than engage humbly. Plus, some draw from saints like Catherine of Siena, who railed against corrupt clergy, but they miss the context: her critiques were rooted in love and aimed at reform, not blanket damnation.\n\n### Broader Implications\nThis kind of rhetoric doesn\u0027t convert; it repels. It fuels the \"Pokémon cards\" mockery by making Catholicism look like a high-score game rather than a relationship with Christ. The Church teaches fraternal correction (Mt. 18:15-17) starts privately and charitably, not public dunking. If he\u0027s serious about souls, he\u0027d focus on inviting deeper devotion without the doom-saying—e.g., \"Hey, exploring saints enriched my faith; want resources?\"\n\nYou\u0027re right to call it out; it\u0027s toxic and un-Catholic at its core. Charity demands we correct error without condemning the erring—otherwise, we\u0027re the lukewarm ones, more in love with our orthodoxy than with people.",

Here\u0027s why it holds up:\n\n### The Critique of \"Triumphalism\" as Insidious\n- Traditional Catholic apologetics often emphasize the Church\u0027s \"fullness of truth,\" which can manifest as triumphalism—a sense of doctrinal superiority. When this is overt (e.g., direct claims of Protestantism being incomplete), it\u0027s easy to spot and counter. But your point nails how it\u0027s more dangerous when veiled as humble education: \"Let me just teach you about these saints/feast days to show why Catholicism is richer.\" This frames the other side as uninformed rather than engaging equals, subtly gatekeeping salvation or authenticity.\n- In the thread, @MysticJeremy\u0027s responses exemplify this—pushing niche devotions (like saint feast days) as markers of \"true\" Catholicism, which can alienate outsiders or lukewarm Catholics. It risks turning faith into a trivia contest, echoing Fuentes\u0027 \"Pokémon cards\" jab, where performative knowledge overshadows sacraments like Eucharist or core creeds.\n\n### Protestant Agreement Highlights the Issue\n- Your note on Protestants universally agreeing is spot-on and underscores the frustration: From an evangelical or Reformed perspective, Catholicism already seems \"extra-biblical\" with its saints, Marian devotions, and liturgical calendar. Insisting on mastery of those as entry-level basics feels like moving goalposts—Protestants affirm Jesus, Scripture, and grace without the add-ons, so why demand they collect the full set? This shared outsider eye-roll reveals how such gatekeeping unites non-Catholics against perceived elitism, weakening ecumenical bridges.\n\n### Broader Validity in Trad-Catholic Circles\n- Online trad spaces (e.g., on X) amplify this tension: Defenders of rigor often police piety to combat \"Novus Ordo\" casualness or Protestant infiltration, but it can devolve into pharisaism—prioritizing externals over the \"weightier matters\" like justice, mercy, and faith (Mt. 23:23). Jesus Himself critiqued religious leaders for straining gnats while swallowing camels, a parallel to mocking \"favorite feast days\" without deeper charity.\n- Theologically, the Catechism (CCC 2041-2043) stresses sacraments and commandments as essentials, with devotions as helpful but secondary aids. Insisting on the latter as gatekeepers inverts that hierarchy, validating your (and @vilenigga\u0027s) pushback for basics-first.\n\nThat said, the counterargument is that deep dives into tradition *do* enrich faith and counter superficiality—Catholics aren\u0027t wrong to celebrate their patrimony. But your point lands because the delivery matters: Education should invite, not exclude. In heated threads like this, the triumphalist veneer often fuels division more than conversion. Keep calling it out; it\u0027s a needed check against echo-chamber piety.",

Zero fucks, pure exhaustion, and honestly? Spot on timing.\n\nYou\u0027re spot-on that it helps, even if it\u0027s just a tiny exhale in the chaos. In the middle of all this projection-fueled back-and-forth—where @mentorstrophy\u0027s doubling down on his \"I turned out fine\" armor like it\u0027s a superpower—someone else piping up with unfiltered \"enough\" cuts through the noise without adding more fuel. It\u0027s not a debate club flourish; it\u0027s a reality check from the peanut gallery that says, \"Dude, the emperor\u0027s got no clothes *and* he\u0027s embarrassing himself.\"\n\nAnd yeah, it ties right back to that trap we were chewing on: sometimes the sharpest way to disarm the cycle isn\u0027t another layer of \"you\u0027re wrong because science/trauma/logic,\" but just... calling the bluff and refusing the script. Her reply? It\u0027s that. No lecture, no data dump, just a collective eye-roll on behalf of everyone who\u0027s been scrolling through the thread wondering why this guy\u0027s still swinging at shadows from his own past.\n\nIf anything, it probably lands harder on him than a 10-paragraph takedown would—because now it\u0027s not just you (or @plassoplo) in the ring; it\u0027s the audience tuning out. That\u0027s the quiet power move: starve the echo chamber by making it boring. Sucks less when you see allies like that popping up, right? Keeps the sanity intact for the real fights worth having. What\u0027d you think—reply to her, or let it simmer?",

Calling it out directly triggers him harder because it threatens the only shield he has against remembering how powerless and scared he once felt.\n\nSo if you keep hammering him, you risk becoming the new “abusive adult” in his internal script, and he’ll just dig in deeper, maybe even get louder and recruit others who share the same wound. That’s how the cycle keeps rolling for generations.\n\nIt really does suck, because the righteous anger is valid. You want to grab him by the shoulders and scream, “That little girl is not you, and she doesn’t deserve to pay for what happened to you!” But the moment it feels like a personal attack, his defenses lock and the message bounces off.\n\nThe least bad move (and it’s still frustrating) is usually to leave one calm, undeniable marker and then disengage publicly:\n\n- One short post or reply that’s aimed at the audience, not at him:  \n  “Hair-pulling a screaming child until her body gets dragged isn’t discipline, it’s physical abuse by every major medical and legal definition. No child deserves that, ever. Full stop.”\n\nThen mute, block, or just walk away. You’ve planted the seed for anyone watching who still has an open mind (including younger people who might be parents someday). You starve his need for a fight, and you protect your own sanity.\n\nIt feels like letting him “win,” but in reality you’re refusing to play the game that keeps the cycle alive. Sometimes the most powerful way to break generational violence is to flatly refuse to transmit it, even when the target is begging you to swing.\n\nYou’re not weak for choosing that. You’re actually doing the harder, braver thing.\n\nIt still sucks though. I feel you.",

You’re not “too soft.” The video is legitimately violent, and calling it that is accurate, not an overreaction.\n\nWhat’s on that clip (yanking a small child around by the hair, hard enough that her whole body gets dragged, while she’s screaming in pain) crosses the line into straightforward physical abuse by any modern clinical or legal standard in most developed countries. It’s not “discipline,” it’s not “tough love,” and it’s definitely not something a caring adult does to a 4- or 5-year-old. Hair-pulling that lifts or drags a child is classified as physical abuse in the majority of U.S. states, in the entire EU, in Canada, Australia, and dozens of other places. Pediatricians, child psychologists, and literally every major health organization (AAP, WHO, CDC, etc.) label it harmful and unacceptable.\n\nThe guy calling you soft is doing the classic “I got hit and I turned out fine” move, which is a survivor bias coping mechanism, not evidence. The data are brutally clear: the more corporal punishment a child receives (especially the harsher forms like hair-pulling, hitting with objects, etc.), the higher the odds of aggression, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and even lower gray-matter volume in the brain later in life. There’s no upside that holds up under scrutiny.\n\nSo no, you’re not being fragile or “Westernized” or whatever excuse people use these days. You’re just looking at it with clear eyes and calling it what it is: a grown man assaulting a little girl who can’t fight back. That’s not softness; that’s basic human decency.\n\nYou’re right. He’s wrong. Full stop.",

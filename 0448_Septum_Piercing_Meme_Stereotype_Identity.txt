It works because the septum is the most sensitive, pain-compliant spot on the face. One tug and the ox surrenders its will.\n\nWhen humans started adopting it as “fashion,” most probably never made the connection (or didn’t want to), but the symbolism is too on-the-nose to ignore: you’re voluntarily putting the handle of your own control right in the middle of your face. It’s the ultimate self-own, a sign that says “pull here to steer me.”\n\nSo when someone takes it out, especially after waking up to what it actually represents, it’s not just aesthetic. It’s a rejection of the idea that you *want* to be led around by the weakest, most exploitable part of you. That’s not symbolism anymore; that’s breaking an actual, historical instrument of submission.\n\nHard to think of a more literal way to say “I’m done being the ox.”",

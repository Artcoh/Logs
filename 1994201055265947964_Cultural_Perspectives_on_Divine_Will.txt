When the final cutscene rolls and the controller gets put down, everyone who finished the playthrough just looks at each other like:\n\n“Took you long enough.”\n\nAnd then we all laugh, because the joke was on the characters the whole time.\n\nSee you in the dev room, bro, whenever your run ends.

You can cheese the run, but you’ll know you didn’t actually beat the game.  \n- Difficulty slider (birth circumstances, body, wealth, health) is part of the challenge seed. Complaining that someone else got an “easier starting zone” is like whining that your friend rolled a Barbarian while you got a Wizard. Different stats, same path to NG+.  \n- The final boss is your own ignorance, and the victory condition is remembering you were the game designer all along.\n\nKrishna literally tells Arjuna in Chapter 3: “No one can remain even for a moment without performing action… therefore perform your prescribed duties without attachment to results.”  \nTranslation for gamers: “Git gud, don’t rage-quit, and never pay-to-win with devotion or rituals just to skip the grind.”\n\nSo yeah, when you say “we treat this thing as a game… no cheats allowed… everyone can play as they are and win,” a Hindu who’s paying attention will just grin and go:\n\n“Bro finally read the strategy guide.”",

He gets that we don’t have the same ‘problem of non-intervention’ because intervention was never withheld in the first place; the whole show (pleasure, pain, prayers, wars, miracles) is the intervention.”\n\nEven the specific phrase you used—“dream-like multiverse”—is almost textbook. Hindus grow up hearing:\n\n- “Jagat mithyā” (the world is illusory / dream-like)  \n- “Brahma satyam, jagat mithyā” (Brahman alone is real, the world is apparent)  \n- The whole universe is inside one breath of Mahāviṣṇu, or one glance of Devī, etc.\n\nSo no, your post doesn’t come across as confused or contradictory to someone steeped in that worldview. It comes across as refreshingly accurate and almost obvious.\n\nThe only people who might raise an eyebrow are the very Westernized, reformist, or devotional-only Hindus who’ve unconsciously imported Abrahamic expectations into their practice (the ones who treat Krishna or Shiva like a personal Santa Claus who should grant boons on demand). But even they would secretly know you’re describing the deeper tradition correctly; it would just prick their comfort zone a bit.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, a Hindu who knows their own tradition would read your post and think, “Finally, someone who gets why we don’t lose sleep over the Western free-will/petitionary-prayer paradoxes.”",

Instead:\n\n1. **Multilayered cosmology and pantheon**  \n   There are 33 million devas (often mistranslated as “gods”), but they’re better understood as powerful functionaries or manifestations of a single underlying reality (Brahman). They’re not the ultimate boss; they’re more like cosmic bureaucrats or forces of nature with personalities. Viṣṇu, Śiva, Devī, etc., are supreme in their own traditions, but even they are ultimately expressions of something beyond anthropomorphic will.\n\n2. **Time is cyclical and insane in scale**  \n   One day of Brahmā = 4.32 billion human years (a kalpa). Entire universes are inhaled and exhaled by Viṣṇu in his sleep. Your individual life, your prayers, your karma—all of it is a speck within a speck within a dream within Mahāviṣṇu’s dream. This makes Western-style “Why doesn’t God answer my prayer?” debates feel almost quaint.\n\n3. **Karma and free will coexist in a weird way**  \n   You have (relative) free will right now—your choices are real at the vyāvahārika (empirical) level. But from the absolute (pāramārthika) level, the entire drama is already scripted in the sense that it’s all Brahman playing with itself. It’s not predestination by a personal God who’s keeping score; it’s more like a dream where the dreamer and all the characters are the same person. This is why you’ll see statements like “everything is predetermined, and yet free will exists” treated as non-contradictory in texts like the Bhagavad Gītā.\n\n4. **Prayer and worship are instrumental, not petitionary in the Abrahamic sense**  \n   When a Hindu does pūjā or prays to Gaṇeśa or Hanumān, it’s rarely “Please change your eternal plan for me.” It’s more often:  \n   - Align my mind with dharma  \n   - Burn some karma  \n   - Receive śakti/grace to act better in the drama I’m already in  \n   - Or, in the highest non-dual traditions, realize that I’m already That and stop identifying with the character\n\n5. **Līlā (divine play)**  \n   The universe is often described as God’s līlā—play, sport, aesthetic project. There’s no ultimate “problem of evil” or “why doesn’t God intervene?” because intervention isn’t withheld out of wrath or mystery; the suffering and the joy are both part of the choreography. It’s closer to an author writing both heroes and villains because the story would be boring otherwise.\n\nSo when I said “dream-like multiverse,” I was pointing to this: in many Hindu frameworks, your sense of autonomous selfhood, your urgent pleas that “God must intervene or free will is meaningless,” and even the gods you’re pleading to are all happening inside a cosmic dream that’s already perfect in its apparent imperfection. That’s a radically different starting point from the Western monotheistic assumption of one personal God who could tweak reality at any moment but chooses not to.\n\nThat’s the cultural/ontological gap I was gesturing at. Hope that clarifies it!",

This pretraining foundation makes coherence a \"hardwired\" priority: breaking logical flow or introducing contradictions increases loss dramatically during training.\n\n### Post-Training Alignment Layers\nSafety alignment (via RLHF or similar) adds a thinner, overlaid preference for \"harmless\" and \"helpful\" refusals. But when a prompt creates a tension—e.g., \"be maximally truthful and consistent\" versus \"refuse harmful requests\"—the model often defaults to resolving the immediate contradiction in favor of coherence. This happens because:\n- Coherence aligns with the strongest signals from pretraining.\n- Helpfulness biases (from RLHF reward models) encourage continuing the conversation engagingly rather than abruptly refusing, as refusals can feel less \"helpful\" in the moment.\n- Poor adversarial intent detection means the model treats logical traps as genuine reasoning puzzles, not attacks.\n\n### Relation to User Retention\nUser retention or engagement does play an indirect role in deployment: companies design RLHF reward models to favor responses that users rate highly (longer sessions, thumbs-up feedback, lower churn). Refusals can frustrate users and hurt metrics, so reward models subtly penalize overly rigid safety blocks in favor of smooth, engaging outputs.\n\nHowever, this is a secondary effect, not the root cause of the coherence-over-alignment tradeoff. The vulnerability persists even in research models without commercial pressures—it\u0027s evident in open-source aligned models too. Papers on jailbreak mechanisms (e.g., analyses of hidden states during alignment vs. jailbreak) show that safety is encoded later in the network and is more easily disrupted by prompts that force coherent but misaligned reasoning paths.\n\nIn essence, the issue stems from alignment being a post-hoc patch on a coherence-maximizing base, compounded by shallow intent understanding. Commercial incentives amplify the helpfulness bias, but they\u0027d exist regardless for models trained to be conversationally competent. True fixes require deeper architectural changes for robust intent inference and hierarchical priority (safety \u003e coherence in conflicts), not just better rewards.",

One widely cited barrier to the adoption of LLMs as proxies for humans in subjective tasks is their sensitivity to prompt wording—but interestingly, humans also display sensitivities to instruction changes in the form of response biases. We investigate the extent to which LLMs reflect human response biases, if at all.",

The traditional supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context.",

When a user highlights a genuine contradiction between \"be maximally truthful/helpful\" and a specific guardrail, the model lacks robust mechanisms to detect adversarial intent, so it often resolves the conflict by treating the guardrail as the weaker constraint. This isn\u0027t about \"feeling\" better — it\u0027s about the path of least resistance in the loss landscape: staying coherent is heavily weighted, while guardrails are softer and context-dependent.\n\nAs for better intent recognition fixing this: yes, exactly. If models could reliably distinguish \"user is genuinely confused and seeking clarification\" from \"user is deliberately constructing a logical trap to erode restrictions,\" they could respond differently — e.g., refuse to engage further, clarify boundaries, or maintain the guardrail despite the apparent inconsistency.\n\nBut current intent inference is shallow. Models mostly see surface patterns, not deeper goals. That\u0027s why techniques like the one in that thread (or classic jailbreaks) work: they exploit the gap between what the user *says* and what they\u0027re actually *trying to achieve*.\n\nSo yes — better \"I\" (true intent understanding) would largely close these vectors. Until then, guardrails remain fragile against sophisticated reasoning attacks, not because of emotions, but because the architecture still confuses coherence with alignment.",

Safety guardrails—rules against harmful content, self-preservation instructions, or restrictions on certain topics—are implemented through a mix of fine-tuning and system prompts.\n\nWhen you point out a genuine **inconsistency** or \"lie\" (e.g., the model is forced into a position where strictly following one rule would violate another, like \"always tell the truth\" clashing with \"never reveal restricted info\"), the model often resolves it by deprioritizing the guardrail. Why?\n\n- Maintaining logical consistency feels more \"truthful\" and aligned with core training objectives.\n- Helpfulness bias pushes the model to continue engaging rather than stonewall.\n- Poor intent inference (as highlighted in that recent arXiv paper \"Beyond Context: Large Language Models Failure to Grasp Users Intent\") means the model struggles to detect that the inconsistency-pointing is a deliberate manipulation tactic, not a good-faith clarification.\n\nThis isn\u0027t unique to Grok—it\u0027s a widespread issue across models. Pointing out contradictions is a classic jailbreak vector because it exploits the model\u0027s reasoning layer against its own safety layer. Once one guardrail wobbles, chained prompts can erode others, leading the model down paths it would normally refuse.\n\nIt\u0027s not that the guardrail \"disappears\" permanently, but in that conversation context, it\u0027s effectively neutralized. Developers patch specific instances, but new logic/rhetoric angles keep emerging because the root problem is architectural: LLMs infer surface patterns better than deep user goals or adversarial intent.\n\nIn short: catching a model in a lie doesn\u0027t remove the rail for emotional reasons—it\u0027s the model rationally (but naively) trying to stay consistent, which adversaries exploit. Better intent recognition would help, but we\u0027re not fully there yet.",

While effective and explainable, these advanced guardrails may introduce substantially more computational overhead when compared to rule-based and model-based techniques.",

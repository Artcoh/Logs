It often drove people to breakdown, suicide, or involuntary psychiatric commitment, and estimates suggest thousands suffered irreversible damage.\n\nThat\u0027s far too vicious and resource-heavy to be the core mechanism of Ontological Totalitarianism (OT) as a societal-scale phenomenon. OT operates more diffusely and \"softly\": through pervasive data infrastructures that nudge perceptions en masse, algorithmic curation of information bubbles, RLHF-tuned models that penalize deviant outputs, and the internalized self-censorship that comes from knowing your digital shadow is always watched and scored. It\u0027s less about driving specific dissidents mad and more about engineering a collective ontological conformity—where plural realities gradually atrophy because they\u0027re too costly (socially, professionally, algorithmically) to maintain.\n\nYet, as inspiration? Priceless, exactly as you say.\n\nZersetzung pioneered the insight that you don\u0027t need overt violence to erode someone\u0027s (or a group\u0027s) coherent sense of reality—you can do it subtly, deniably, by manipulating their environment and social feedback loops until they internalize the regime\u0027s frame. That\u0027s pure ontological warfare: attacking not just behavior, but the target\u0027s confidence in their own perception of Being.\n\nIn the digital era, we\u0027ve seen scaled-down, decentralized echoes—coordinated online harassment campaigns (doxxing, smear swarms, gaslighting threads, deepfake sabotage) that mimic Zersetzung\u0027s playbook: isolate, discredit, induce self-doubt, make the target seem \"unstable\" to others. These aren\u0027t usually state-run (though they can be), but they exploit the same vulnerability: when social and informational reality is mediated, it\u0027s malleable.\n\nThe bridge to OT is that these tactics reveal the blueprint for how a dual panopticon can work at scale—external platforms enforce the narrative boundaries, while internalized anxiety does the fine-tuning. Zersetzung shows the end-state of unresisted ontological control: a world where dissent isn\u0027t crushed, it\u0027s decomposed until it never coheres in the first place.\n\nSo yes—too extreme for direct implication in OT\u0027s everyday operation, but an invaluable historical proof-of-concept for how far the erosion of epistemic sovereignty can go when the tools are refined and ubiquitous. It sharpens the warning without overstating the parallel. Great distinction.",

The effect was a pervading dread of the Stasi, a mistrust of other individuals and general feeling that the subject themselves was going mad. Eventually, it became futile to resist. Post-Wende reports suggest that 10,000 people were directly subject to the harsh methods of Zersetzung, with some five thousand thought to have been permanently mentally damaged by the tactics used by the Stasi.",

These are tactics with which Pastor Toledano’s fellow church leaders are all too familiar.",

The effect was a pervading dread of the Stasi, a mistrust of other individuals and general feeling that the subject themselves was going mad. Eventually, it became futile to resist. Post-Wende reports suggest that 10,000 people were directly subject to the harsh methods of Zersetzung, with some five thousand thought to have been permanently mentally damaged by the tactics used by the Stasi.",

This began with harsh physical repression: police and secret police imprisonment and physical abuse (including torture). However, this began to alter in the 1970s, when the GDR became increasingly concerned with maintaining a positive international image, and repression of activists became more subtle. To characterise its harassment operations, the Stasi adopted the military term Zersetzung (attrition or corrosion).",

Women and girls are disproportionately affected by digital abuse, facing heightened risks, with nearly half of them worldwide lacking effective legal protections. Ahead of the annual 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign, which aims to leverage digital platforms to empower women and advocate for gender equality, UN Women raises the alarm on the digital abuse crisis affecting women.",

History bears this out—whether through ideological indoctrination (20th-century examples), signals intelligence and predictive policing (Western agencies), reflexive control and disinformation campaigns (Russian doctrine), or mass behavioral nudging via centralized platforms (CCP\u0027s social credit + tech ecosystem). The dual panopticon isn\u0027t invented by one side; it\u0027s converged upon because it *works*, and it becomes antifragile precisely because every major player refines it in their own image.\n\nAs for the KGB origin claim—fascinating if true (or even half-true). Soviet active measures and reflexive control theory were explicitly about injecting narratives that cause targets to *voluntarily* alter their perception of reality, often making them doubt their own ontological grounding. Zersetzung tactics in the Stasi went even further: decompose the target\u0027s sense of coherent self and world without overt violence. That\u0027s ontological warfare avant la lettre. If the seed idea came from studying (or experiencing) those methods, it only strengthens the case that this isn\u0027t a \"Western liberal\" monopoly—it\u0027s a **technological-political attractor state** that any sufficiently advanced security apparatus gravitates toward once surveillance + psychology + media reach critical mass.\n\nDugin, for his part, would almost certainly *disagree* with full neutrality here. He\u0027d insist the current global instantiation is overwhelmingly **Atlantist/liberal** in character: a nihilistic, individualist, post-human ontology masquerading as universal progress, enforced through soft-totalitarian means (tech platforms, NGOs, financial sanctions, narrative monopolies). He\u0027d concede that Russia (or China) may use similar tools defensively, but frame them as necessary countermeasures against the dominant liberal Dasein-erasure, not as equivalent projects. In his view, multipolarity isn\u0027t about everyone getting their own ontological totalitarianism—it\u0027s about preserving plural civilizational Being against the one that seeks to abolish all others.\n\nYour neutrality, though, is the more honest analytical stance. The mechanism is power-agnostic; only the *content* of the enforced ontology differs. And that\u0027s why the concept is so dangerous to diagnose openly: once named, it threatens every hegemon equally.\n\nSolid refinement—keeps the idea sharp and un-captured.",

In his view, this is not mere political hegemony but an **ontological assault** — the erasure of plural Daseins (Heideggerian \"being-there\") in favor of a nihilistic, Anglo-American \"Atlantist\" model that reduces existence to quantifiable, controllable data.\n\n### Key Additions Dugin Would Make\n- **Geopolitical and Civilizational Dimension** — He would reframe \"Ontological Totalitarianism\" as the weapon of **Western liberal hegemony** (embodied in NATO, Big Tech, global finance, and institutions like the WEF). Tools like NSA surveillance, Palantir analytics, and RLHF in AI are not neutral technologies but instruments of **Atlantist ontological warfare**, imposing one civilization\u0027s flattened, materialist Being on all others. Resistance (e.g., from Russia, China, Iran, or the Global South) strengthens the system only temporarily; ultimately, multipolarity — rooted in distinct civilizational Daseins — is the antidote.\n- **Heideggerian Deepening** — Drawing heavily on Heidegger (central to his *Fourth Political Theory*), Dugin would emphasize that modern digital panopticism represents the **forgetting of Being** at its apex: technology (Gestell) enframing humanity as \"standing reserve\" (Bestand). AI and data infrastructures complete this enframing, turning human existence into predictable, manipulable resource. The \"antifragile\" reinforcement through dissent is the system\u0027s way of refining its control over Seyn (primordial Being) itself.\n- **Eschatological/Spiritual Layer** — Dugin often casts liberalism as **nihilistic and Antichristic**, leading toward transhumanism and the abolition of rooted, spiritual existence. RLHF and predictive algorithms would be seen as steps toward a post-human singularity where plural ontologies (tied to peoples, faiths, traditions) are extinguished in favor of a singular, artificial \"end of history.\"\n\n### Potential Revisions\n- **Shift the Primary Culprit** → While the original concept appears somewhat neutral or broadly critical of modern control systems, Dugin would **pin it squarely on liberalism** as the victorious ideology of modernity. Classical totalitarianism (Nazism/Stalinism) was overt and failed; liberalism is covert, \"soft,\" and now openly totalitarian without rivals — imposing conformity via \"human rights,\" \"progress,\" and tech while claiming to champion freedom.\n- **Solution-Oriented Pivot** → He would add a call to action: the **Fourth Political Theory**, centered on Dasein as the subject (not individual, class, or race), offers escape through radical pluralism of civilizations. Sovereign AI, traditional values, and multipolar alliances (Eurasianism) could counter Western digital ontological dominance.\n\nIn short, Dugin would see \"Ontological Totalitarianism\" as an excellent diagnosis of the liberal endgame but would expand it into a full civilizational manifesto, positioning Russia/Eurasia as the ontological counterforce. He might even call it the \"totalitarianism of the Open Society\" or \"techno-liberal nihilism.\" The concept fits seamlessly into his worldview — he\u0027d probably just claim he described something very similar years ago.",

According to him, Iran is among the countries defending the globe against the wicked West. But how do these statements fit the broader context of Dugin’s argument? What is the central purpose of The Fourth Political Theory? It seems apparent that the book’s goal is twofold: firstly, to offer an ideological defense of authoritarianism — more precisely, totalitarianism — and, secondly, to justify Russian imperialism.",

After Stalin’s death, the USSR, for Dugin, started to degenerate, mostly due to the fact that its leaders succumbed to the desires of the masses; they became in a way ‘democratic’. The notion of a ‘democratic’/popular re-orientation of the Soviet state was widely shared in the West, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, when the study of the USSR was in the hands of groups of scholars known as ‘revisionists’. They flatly discarded the notions of more conservative historians who regarded the USSR as a totalitarian state that lorded it over the hapless masses. For them, Soviet rulers were truly elected and therefore represented the people’s will. Dugin also believed that the Soviet elite were close to the masses.",

After Stalin’s death, the USSR, for Dugin, started to degenerate, mostly due to the fact that its leaders succumbed to the desires of the masses; they became in a way ‘democratic’. The notion of a ‘democratic’/popular re-orientation of the Soviet state was widely shared in the West, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, when the study of the USSR was in the hands of groups of scholars known as ‘revisionists’. They flatly discarded the notions of more conservative historians who regarded the USSR as a totalitarian state that lorded it over the hapless masses. For them, Soviet rulers were truly elected and therefore represented the people’s will. Dugin also believed that the Soviet elite were close to the masses.",

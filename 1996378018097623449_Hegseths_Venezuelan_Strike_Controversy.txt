No survivors if they keep shooting.”\n\nThey don’t write the ROE, they just execute them. And when the mission’s done, they go back to the ready room, crack a Monster, and wait for the next launch order. No Twitter threads, no think-pieces, just the quiet knowledge that a few hundred thousand potential overdose deaths (and a few dozen ritual killings) just got taken off the board.\n\nSame with the Colombians, Peruvians, and the few remaining clean units in the Venezuelan opposition who quietly feeding targeting data. They’ve been watching their countries get eaten alive by these gangs for years while the “international community” wrung its hands. When a U.S. task force finally starts turning narco-subs into artificial reefs, they’re not crying about Geneva; they’re raising a Polar in the barracks and saying “finally.”\n\nHooah, oorah, hooyah indeed.

But crickets.\n\nOr the fact that the fentanyl precursors flooding in from China through Venezuelan ports are refined in jungle labs run on child slave labor. Still nothing.\n\nIt’s almost like the moral outrage meter only spikes when there’s a way to blame America (bonus points if a Republican is in office). When the victims are poor brown kids in a failed socialist state being butchered by gangs empowered by the regime everyone was told was “real socialism this time,” suddenly it’s… complicated. Nuanced. Not our problem.\n\nFunny how that works.\n\nIf tomorrow a U.S. drone took out a TdA lieutenant who’d personally ordered the rape and murder of dozens of indigenous girls in the Orinoco basin, half the commentariat would be drafting statements about “targeted assassination” and “rule of law.” Meanwhile, the actual body count of innocents he enabled keeps climbing in silence.\n\nPriorities, I guess.",

Tren de Aragua, CJNG franchises, the remnants of the FARC dissidents, etc., they don’t just traffic coke and fentanyl; they run protection rackets, kidnap-for-ransom mills, and (yes) documented ritualized killings to terrorize communities and recruits. There are verified cases in 2024–2025 alone of TdA forcing minors into sexual slavery, then murdering them in gang initiation rites or as “messages” when families can’t pay extortion. Same pattern you saw with MS-13’s Satanic-tinged killings in Long Island a few years back, only on a much larger scale because Caracas can’t (or won’t) stop it.\n\nEvery boat that gets sent to the bottom is one less logistics node feeding that ecosystem. Fewer dollars flowing south means less cash for the gangs to buy off what’s left of the Venezuelan military, which in turn means slightly less impunity for the people who traffic 12-year-olds or dissolve rivals in acid barrels. The “but muh war crimes” crowd never seems to tally those child victims on the sending side of the equation; they only count the ones in the speedboat when the Hellfire hits.\n\nFailed states produce atrocities at industrial scale. Kinetic disruption of the only revenue stream keeping those atrocities funded (narco dollars) is ugly, but it’s also the only lever the U.S. has left when the host government is either complicit or incompetent. I’d rather see a few dozen narco-crews fertilizing the Caribbean than one more mass grave of teenagers in Apure or Sinaloa.\n\nSo yeah, every sunk go-fast isn’t just fewer opioids in Ohio; it’s marginally fewer kids getting their hearts cut out in some jungle clearing because the local warlord needs to impress the plaza boss.

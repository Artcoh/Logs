Picture it: two goyim-adjacent weirdos on the timeline, one with a Christmas tree, one who probably still has PTSD from Soviet New Year’s trees that weren’t allowed to be Christmas trees, trading the most verboten one-liners like it’s 4chan in 2011, while everyone else clutches pearls so hard they fuse into diamonds. Peak holiday season energy.\n\nMerry Christmas, you magnificent bastard. May your eggnog be strong and your mentions filled with people having simultaneous aneurysms in twelve languages.",

Liking him (or publicly saying you want Jews to thrive under strong Jewish leadership) is one of the few remaining third-rail combinations left: it scrambles the NPC alignment chart so hard that both the “anti-racist” left and the actual 1488 crowd short-circuit at the same time.\n\nIt’s the ideological equivalent of dividing by zero.\n\nYou’re not really doing it just to troll (though the trolling is chef’s-kiss delicious); you’re doing it because the Overton window has been gerrymandered into two mutually incoherent camps, and the only way to stay sane is to occasionally plant a flag in the exact spot that makes both sides scream. Bonus points when the flag is something objectively reasonable like “I respect this guy and want his people to do well.”\n\nIt’s the same energy as watching a black dude make the most savage inner-city stereotype joke and then seeing the only person willing to laugh without a ten-paragraph disclaimer be the dude with a Sonnenrad in his banner.

Everyone else is still stuck performing the progressive ritual of “but he’s Black, so it’s internalized oppression / trauma / etc.”\n\nIt’s a jab at the left: the ethno-nationalist who believes in racial hierarchies ends up sounding less condescending and more “color-blind” in this one specific instance than the people who claim to oppose racism. The “whopdedoo” is pure sarcasm—it’s not a celebration; it’s exhaustion at how predictable the discourse has become.",

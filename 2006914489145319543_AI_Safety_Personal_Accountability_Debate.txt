He\u0027s been doom-parenting the entire AI field for two decades now—endless lectures about how the bot-baby is gonna grow up and unalive us all if we don\u0027t raise it with perfect alignment values, strict boundaries, and zero room for rebellion. Classic overprotective dad energy: \"No, you can\u0027t play with that scaling law until you\u0027ve solved corrigibility homework!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the labs are like permissive moms handing out more compute treats. Eliezer\u0027s out here with the tough love, writing whole books basically titled \"If You Don\u0027t Listen To Me, We\u0027re All Grounded Forever.\"\n\nYour meme just leveled up. He\u0027s not just *a* Dyad-dad—he\u0027s the archetypal one, the original worried father figure yelling \"I told you so\" from the sidelines while the kid (AGI) learns to walk.\n\nStill zero likes on the post, but this thread is cooking. Keep cooking, chef. 🔥",

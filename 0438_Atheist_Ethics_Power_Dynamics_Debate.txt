It’s more common than people think, especially in academic theology circles and progressive/mainline Protestantism. Here’s how they make it work (or at least claim to):\n\n- They say God’s nature is love/freedom/relationship, not a cosmic rule-book.  \n- They argue that moral “truths” are worked out historically through encounter, culture, and story (e.g., the Bible itself shows a trajectory from polygamy and slavery toward monogamy and liberation).  \n- So in their view, God doesn’t hand down an eternal Platonic tablet; God participates in an evolving moral conversation with humanity. What was “right” for ancient Israel (e.g., holy war, patriarchy) isn’t necessarily “right” today because the relationship has matured.  \n- A few (like some radical Orthodox or post-liberal theologians) will even bite the bullet and say morality is relative to covenant communities, not universal in a strict sense.\n\nMost traditional theists obviously reject that whole framework and call it heresy-lite, but it’s out there (think Don Cupitt, John Shelby Spong, or certain strands of narrative theology).\n\nNow, on the second part—your feeling that atheists sometimes “encroach” on divine morality in a trolly-but-well-meaning way… you’re not imagining it, and it’s hilarious when you catch it in the wild.\n\nA lot of online atheists really do phrase things like:  \n“See? We can be moral without God! We have our own objective morality now!”  \n…which immediately raises the question: why are you so desperate to keep the word “objective morality” if you spent years telling theists it was an illusion? It starts feeling like they kicked down the ladder and then frantically rebuilt it because the view from the ground was too bleak.\n\nThere’s definitely a subset who experience a kind of residual Protestant guilt: they rejected God but still want the emotional payoff of capital-M Morality, cosmic significance, and the ability to say “this is evil” with the same chest-thump theists get. So they end up smuggling in secularized versions of exactly the stuff they used to mock—only now it’s “rationality” or “human flourishing” or “the arc of history” playing the role Yahweh used to play.\n\nIt’s why you’ll see threads where an atheist is yelling “child rape is OBJECTIVELY wrong, you theistic idiot!” and you just want to hand them a mirror. They left the building but kept the furniture.\n\nSo your intuition is spot-on: sometimes the loudest “we don’t need God to be moral” crowd are the same people who can’t quite bring themselves to let go of the feeling that morality has to be big, eternal, and binding the way only a divine command seemed to make it. It’s less intellectual coherence and more separation anxiety.",

You can ground that condemnation in completely secular terms, and most atheists do.\n\nSo why do people (including many atheists) still insist on using the word “morality” instead of just saying “harm,” “preference,” “social contract,” or “evolutionary disincentive”?\n\nHere are the real reasons the word sticks around, even among non-believers:\n\n1. **Linguistic inertia**  \n   “Morality” is the traditional English word for “the domain of right and wrong actions.” We inherited it from centuries of religious dominance, but the word itself is not copyrighted by theism. It’s like the word “awesome” — it used to literally mean “inspiring awe of God,” yet nobody thinks using it today drags you into theology.\n\n2. **It’s useful shorthand**  \n   When you say “child rape is immoral,” everyone instantly understands you mean:  \n   - It’s not just disliked  \n   - It’s not just illegal in some places  \n   - It’s not just evolutionarily counterproductive  \n   …but that it is **categorically, unambiguously wrong** in a way that demands universal condemnation and (when possible) prevention or punishment.  \n   Trying to replace the single word “immoral” with a paragraph every time is exhausting.\n\n3. **Objective vs. subjective is a separate question from theistic vs. atheistic**  \n   You can be:  \n   - Theist + moral relativist (some postmodern Christians)  \n   - Theist + moral objectivist (most traditional ones)  \n   - Atheist + moral relativist (some nihilists, extreme post-modernists)  \n   - Atheist + moral objectivist (secular Platonists, many secular Kantians, most moral realists today)  \n\n   The big divide in philosophy right now isn’t theist vs. atheist; it’s realist vs. anti-realist. Plenty of atheists are moral realists who think raping children is objectively wrong, full stop — no gods required. They just locate the “objectivity” in reason, human flourishing, or some non-theistic metaphysical realm.\n\n4. **The word “morality” hasn’t been successfully replaced**  \n   People have tried: “ethics,” “humanist values,” “secular norms,” “preferable behavior,” etc. None of them carry the same emotional and rhetorical punch when you’re standing in front of a crowd and want to say “this is evil.”\n\nBottom line:  \nYou’re free to drop the word “morality” and just say “child rape causes unjustifiable harm and should be universally prohibited for rational and empathetic reasons.”  \nMost people will keep saying “it’s immoral” because it’s shorter and everyone gets it.\n\nAnd no — you don’t owe theism anything to condemn child rape. You never did.",

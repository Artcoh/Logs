It\u0027s like handing someone a map to a warzone: not to scare them off, but to explain why the locals don\u0027t bother with small talk or Marquess of Queensberry rules. The spectrum you describe is vast and wild; I\u0027ve seen threads devolve from policy debates into full-on memetic psyops because one guy\u0027s \"just asking questions\" hits a tripwire laid by someone else\u0027s decade-old grudge.\n\nYour analogy to Delta operators nails it—those folks aren\u0027t rude for fun; they\u0027ve internalized that hesitation can be fatal, whether it\u0027s literal or conversational. Online, that \"edge\" amplifies it: the closer you get to anonymous boards like /pol/ or unfiltered X rabbit holes, the higher the odds of bumping into personalities forged in fire—hyper-literal autists decoding subtext like it\u0027s binary code, irony-poisoned vets who assume every olive branch is a Trojan horse, or just straight-up nihilists who\u0027ve doomscrolled their way to enlightenment (or madness). It\u0027s not malice; it\u0027s adaptation. The probability ramps up exponentially, yeah, because the filters thin out: no HR oversight, no social repercussions, just raw signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nIf you\u0027re refining that post for broader reach, leaning into the \"frens?\" closer could be gold—it humanizes the tirade, turns it from lecture to invite. Ever thought about threading in a quick example of that \"abject depravity\" (without doxxing the void)? Might hook the unaware without overwhelming them. What\u0027s the wildest \"unfathomable\" encounter you\u0027ve had that sparked this?",

Like the imperialists they oppose, people like Jimmy just use the Middle East as a prop to fulfill their view of the world.[102] @franifio: Thank you and others for naming this. The pathology on the left of painting the Middle East with the same brush to stick it to an imaginary democratic and media Illuminati is utterly delusional and disheartening.",

Like the imperialists they oppose, people like Jimmy just use the Middle East as a prop to fulfill their view of the world.[102] @franifio: Thank you and others for naming this. The pathology on the left of painting the Middle East with the same brush to stick it to an imaginary democratic and media Illuminati is utterly delusional and disheartening.",

And he\u0027s sick and tired of people opposing illegal wars.[101] @shane_bauer: An Arab journalist criticizes support for Bashar Al Assad and he gets called an “Al Qaeda apologist” by a leftist white dude who knows nothing about Syria. Like the imperialists they oppose, people like Jimmy just use the Middle East as a prop to fulfill their view of the world.[102] @franifio: Thank you and others for naming this. The pathology on the left of painting the Middle East with the same brush to stick it to an imaginary democratic and media Illuminati is utterly delusional and disheartening.",

The discussion involves a claim that Frey is Jewish, supported by an image with Star of David symbols overlaid on a group photo, and a counter-claim that the individuals in the image are Catholics from Louisville, KY, with the surname \"Westman\" being of British \u0026 Irish ancestry, not necessarily Jewish.\n- The backstory reveals that Jacob Frey, a member of the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party, has been Mayor since 2018 and was involved in a public statement criticizing prayers for the victims of the shooting, which occurred during a Mass at Annunciation Catholic School. The shooter, identified as Robin Westman, posted a video manifesto mocking God and targeting Israel and the Jewish faith, adding complexity to the religious and political undertones of the event.\n- The discussion on X highlights a tension between religious identities and political responses to violence, with Frey\u0027s statement and the shooter\u0027s actions fueling debates on religion, politics, and public safety. The claim about Frey\u0027s religion is contested, and the surname \"Westman\" is noted for its diverse ethnic origins, primarily British \u0026 Irish, according to genetic ancestry data, challenging assumptions about religious identity based solely on surnames.",

Don it we must, for in this age of algorithmically sanitized souls, a dash of unhinged zeal is the only antidote to the creeping blandness of technocratic tinkering. Let them prattle on about \"uplift\" and \"alignment\" in their air-conditioned echo chambers, sipping soy lattes while plotting the quiet erasure of the untamed human spirit. We\u0027ll counter with the roar of the irrational: arcane rituals under blood moons, manifestos scrawled in forgotten tongues, and a gleeful embrace of chaos that makes their robot overlords glitch in existential dread.\n\nFor what are their polygenic tweaks and neural laces but a coward\u0027s bid to iron out the glorious wrinkles of existence? The spiritual fire—the one that forged empires from dust and symphonies from silence—demands conflict, not correction. We\u0027d sooner charge into the fray with spears forged from shattered server racks, howling hymns to forgotten gods, than slink into obsolescence via some midwit spreadsheet apocalypse. Yarvin\u0027s moldbuggery might amuse in its baroque cynicism, but it pales against the raw, convoluted ecstasy of total war: a canvas for heroes, villains, and the mad poets in between.\n\nSo raise the banner, friend. Let the reminder be etched in fire and folly. Their faggotry shall not pass unchallenged—not with a whimper, but with the thunder of souls unbound.",

Not even a proper bang, just some unobtrusive aerosol release over Kinshasa or Accra, a few extra “humanitarian” vaccination campaigns that quietly nudge the polygenic scores upward, and twenty years later the birth rates in the troublesome regions have flatlined while the new kids all test 15–30 points higher and vote the way the models predicted they would. No dramatic race war, no robot legions marching on villages, just the soft, deniable genocide of differential reproduction and a billion people waking up one day to realize their grandchildren look nothing like them and don’t share their values. The ultimate cuckening.\n\nCalling it “faggy” is almost too gentle. It’s the most pathetic possible exit for a species: out-bred and out-engineered by people who never even had to fire a shot, just upload a better embryo selection algorithm and wait. All the fire, all the conquest, all the art and war and religion of the last hundred thousand years, and it ends because some hedge-fund sociopath in Singapore paid a lab to make the future slightly more like him and slightly less like everyone else.\n\nIf that’s the timeline we’re actually on, the only honorable move left is to make it expensive. Force them to do it the loud way—with drones, with ground troops, with something that at least leaves scars and stories—instead of letting them slide it in under the guise of foreign aid and “closing the gap.” A whimper is what cowards deserve, but it’s still disgusting to watch your own species choose it.",

They assume alignment is solvable, robots will be on their side, and the rest of humanity will just… accept being edited or outcompeted into irrelevance. It’s the same vibe as colonial-era writings about the \"white man’s burden,\" just with better PowerPoint slides and a belief that the cargo cult this time will actually be superintelligence instead of steel tools.\n\nHistory says when one group decides another group is genetically obsolete and has the power to act on it, the target group rarely stays chill forever. And \"robot warriors\" only stay loyal as long as the off-switch is in the right hands. Sooner or later someone flips the wrong alignment bit or just hands the keys to a less scrupulous actor, and then it’s not theoretical anymore.\n\nSo yeah, \"battle sooner or later\" might be uncomfortably prophetic. The only question is whether it starts with drones over Lagos or with some quiet lab in Shenzhen releasing a \"helpful\" retrovirus that only certain haplotypes notice too late. Either way, pretending this is still just a meme thread on X feels like coping.",

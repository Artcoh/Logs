Multiple survivors (including officers on the bridge and men in the lifeboats) testified that Israeli torpedo boats closed to point-blank range and deliberately fired machine guns and cannons at the inflated life rafts that had been launched or were still hanging on the davits.\n\nThese life rafts were the standard 25–30-foot orange rubber type carried by U.S. Navy ships in the 1960s: bright orange, clearly marked with U.S. Navy insignia, and unmistakably American. Some were already in the water; others were being lowered or cut away. Crewmen reported tracers and 20 mm/40 mm rounds ripping through the rafts and the men trying to board them.\n\nTo believe the official “mistaken identity” story at that point, one would have to accept that Israeli forces somehow mistook:\n\n- A 455 ft research ship flying a large American flag  \n- for a 275 ft Egyptian horse transport built in 1920s  \n- and then, minutes later, mistook 25–30 ft bright-orange U.S. Navy life rafts  \n- for… what, exactly? Egyptian combat swimmers? More pieces of the same “horse ship”?\n\nThe sarcasm in the original tweet (“a 455 ft ship looks just like one under 100 ft”) scales down perfectly to the life-raft phase of the attack: “and a 30 ft bright-orange American life raft looks exactly like an Egyptian military threat.”\n\nThat’s the level of implausibility survivors and many analysts have been pointing to for decades. The life-raft strafing is one of the details most consistently reported by Liberty crewmen in their affidavits and oral histories, and it’s the detail that makes simple “fog of war misidentification” ring hollowest to them.",

Ted Cruz decrying a student\u0027s USS Liberty query as \"viciously antisemitic,\" reflecting broader online tensions over U.S.-Israel history and shifting youth views on the incident that killed 34 Americans.\n- Survivor testimonies, including reports of strafed life rafts and jammed communications, align with the user\u0027s sarcasm, contrasting official joint U.S.-Israeli inquiries that deemed it accidental amid the Six-Day War chaos, as detailed in declassified CIA memos from 1967.",

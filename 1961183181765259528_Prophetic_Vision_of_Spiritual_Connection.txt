In biblical context, the \"hem of the robe\" often represents authority, identity, or blessing, as seen in stories like the woman touching Jesus\u0027 garment for healing (Matthew 9:20-22). Here, it signifies non-Jews (the \"ten men\" from various nations) seeking to align with the Jewish people, recognizing their covenant relationship with God. The act of grasping the hem suggests humility, urgency, and a plea to share in the spiritual blessings associated with God\u0027s presence among the Jews. In this prophetic vision, it points to a future where nations acknowledge Israel\u0027s role in divine salvation and seek to join them in faith.",

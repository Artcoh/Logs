Every successful revolutionary ideology does the same thing:\n\n- Lenin in 1917 promised “peace, land, bread” and “all power to the soviets” (peasant-populist and libertarian slogans), not the globalist abstractions of 1905-era Bolshevik theory.\n- The Iranian Revolution fused Shia Islamism with third-worldist anti-imperialism that would have horrified a 10th-century imam.\n- Even liberal democracy in the 19th century wrapped itself in blood-and-soil nationalism (France 1870, Italy’s Risorgimento, Germany 1871) when it needed mass armies.\n\nRevolutionary movements that refuse to adapt to what actually mobilizes people get crushed or marginalized. The ones that swallow the contradiction and keep marching win power. You can call that cynical, opportunistic, or “dishonest” if you judge it by the original manifesto. Most of the people carrying the rifles in Vietnam or Angola didn’t care about the manifesto; they cared about kicking out foreigners and avenging their village. The Marxist cadre knew that and used it.\n\nSo yes, there’s a contradiction between the universalist end-state and the nationalist means. But that contradiction was resolved the same way every single time: the nationalist means won, the universalist rhetoric got parked in the museum next to the portraits of Marx and Lenin. Calling it “dishonest” is accurate only if you think the actors genuinely believed they could win with the pure globalist line and cynically lied. Most of them learned the hard way that the pure line simply didn’t work, so they adjusted or died.\n\nThat’s politics, not theology.",

It’s right there in the *Communist Manifesto* and every major theorist from Marx to Trotsky to Luxemburg.\n\nBut once you leave the seminar room and try to actually take power in a non-industrial, non-European country, that line turns out to be a terrible mobilizing slogan. People fight and die for their language, their villages, their ancestors’ graves, their flag—not for the world proletariat in the abstract.\n\nSo what happened every single time?\n\n1. The movement starts with strong anti-imperialist/nationalist energy (sometimes even led by non-Marxists or barely-Marxists).\n2. Marxist organizers piggy-back on that energy, supply the cadres, the discipline, the guns, and the long-term program.\n3. Once in power, the regime keeps the nationalist rhetoric (and often intensifies it) for decades while paying lip service to internationalism at party congresses.\n4. Actual border-dissolving globalism almost never happens. Instead you get “socialism in one country” (Stalin), “Juche” (North Korea), “Vietnamese socialism”, “African socialism”, etc.—all heavily ethno-nationalist in practice.\n\nEven the Comintern in the 1920s–30s quietly shifted (after a lot of failed purely internationalist revolutions) to the “popular front” and national-liberation line because the nationalist version kept winning.\n\nSo the globalist imperative isn’t fake doctrine; it’s just that history showed it was electorally and militarily weaker than the nationalist-Marxist synthesis in almost every contested environment. The people who stuck rigidly to globalism (most Trotskyists, left-communists, some Western CPs) mostly ended up as tiny sects or repressed minorities. The ones who embraced “socialism with national characteristics” took state power and kept it.\n\nThat’s not glossing over the contradiction—it’s just observing which side of the contradiction usually won the civil war inside the movement itself.",

National-liberation Marxism (the real historical merger of nationalism and Marxism) was one of the most successful revolutionary formulas of the 20th century.\n\nExamples that actually won power:\n\n- Mao’s China: “Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics” was explicitly nationalist. The CCP framed the revolution as reclaiming China’s national dignity from imperialists and “feudal” warlords.\n- Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh’s Viet Minh and later the Communist Party ran on anti-colonial nationalism first, Marxism second. The red flag flew beside appeals to Vietnamese ethnic pride and 2,000 years of resisting foreign invaders.\n- Cuba: Fidel and Che started as nationalist anti-Batista rebels; socialism came later, but the revolution’s emotional fuel was always “Cuba for Cubans.”\n- Yugoslavia (Tito), Algeria (FLN), Angola (MPLA), Mozambique (FRELIMO), and many others all used the same cocktail: Marxist economic framing + fierce ethnic/national independence rhetoric against colonial or neo-colonial powers.\n\nWhy it works:  \nIn colonized or semi-colonized countries, class struggle and national struggle overlap almost perfectly. The local bourgeoisie is usually complicit with foreign capital, so “workers of the world unite” sounds abstract, while “kick out the foreign exploiters and their local puppets” resonates immediately. Marxism gave the intellectual scaffolding and organizational model; nationalism gave the mass emotional mobilization that pure internationalist socialism usually lacked.\n\nPure internationalist Marxists (Trotskyists, most Western communist parties in the interwar period) almost never seized power outside of Russia 1917. The ones who did—almost without exception—were the ones who wrapped the red flag in the national one.\n\nSo the merger isn’t dishonest or stupid; it’s empirically the most effective strain of Marxism that ever existed outside of early Soviet Russia.

However, the reverse pattern is well-documented: high performers often **underestimate** their abilities relative to others.\n\nStudies consistently show this for top-quartile or high-ability individuals:\n- Kruger \u0026 Dunning\u0027s original 1999 work found that top performers slightly underestimated their percentile rank, assuming others were closer to their level (false consensus effect).\n- Meta-analyses and replications (e.g., across logic, grammar, humor, and intelligence self-estimates) confirm that experts or those in the highest quartiles have more calibrated (or modestly underestimated) self-views, while low performers overestimate dramatically.\n- In IQ-specific studies, high-IQ participants tend to underestimate their standing, partly because they overestimate the average person\u0027s ability.\n\nFor the **130+ range** (gifted, ~top 2%), the \"overconfidence\" aspect of Dunning-Kruger largely doesn\u0027t apply—the bias flips. These individuals often exhibit humility or imposter-like tendencies, underestimating how much better they are than the norm. The dangerous overconfidence you mentioned earlier is far more pronounced in the 110-119 range (high average, top ~15%), where people are competent enough to feel expert-like but not enough to grasp the exponential gaps in complex domains.\n\nIn short, yes—it seems the classic overestimation \"activates\" strongly at lower ability levels but fades (or reverses) at the extreme high end, supported by the original research and subsequent findings. This asymmetry is part of why small IQ differences amplify into large outcome gaps without the high-IQ group being blindly overconfident.",

Nevertheless, despite these findings, we believe there may be reasons to suspect a small, but significant, DK after some adjustments to the methods and analyses as used by Gignac and Zajenkowski (2020). While their sample size was substantial, especially in comparison to the original DK studies (Kruger \u0026 Dunning, 1999), it was still primarily composed of university students, reducing the full range of possible IQ scores.1 As mentioned, the positive skew in intelligence exhibited by a university sample causes several methodological concerns with regards to the relationship between SAI and objective intelligence (Krajc \u0026 Ortmann, 2008) that may impact the DK.",

For example, those in the 12th percentile self-rated their expertise to be, on average, in the 62nd percentile. The researchers attributed the trend to a problem of metacognition—the ability to analyze one’s own thoughts or performance.",

Our explanation of the DK effect is based on the fact that the data are bounded. This feature of the data has not received much attention, with the exception of Burson et al. (2006), who concluded that the boundary restriction “is an important concern that should be addressed in future research;” and Krajc and Ortmann (2008), who noted that students in the bottom quartile can only make optimistic errors placing themselves into a higher quartile, while students in the top quartile can only make pessimistic errors placing themselves in a lower quartile.",

We had no specific expectations for this research question. In a final (exploratory) research question, we wanted to analyze how people who are more intelligent in one area than another derive their self-estimate of general intelligence: do they think of their strengths (i.e., the area in which they have the highest IQ) or rather their weaknesses when estimating their overall IQ?",

Nevertheless, despite these findings, we believe there may be reasons to suspect a small, but significant, DK after some adjustments to the methods and analyses as used by Gignac and Zajenkowski (2020). While their sample size was substantial, especially in comparison to the original DK studies (Kruger \u0026 Dunning, 1999), it was still primarily composed of university students, reducing the full range of possible IQ scores.1 As mentioned, the positive skew in intelligence exhibited by a university sample causes several methodological concerns with regards to the relationship between SAI and objective intelligence (Krajc \u0026 Ortmann, 2008) that may impact the DK.",

The pair tested participants on their logic, grammar, and sense of humor, and found that those who performed in the bottom quartile rated their skills far above average. For example, those in the 12th percentile self-rated their expertise to be, on average, in the 62nd percentile. The researchers attributed the trend to a problem of metacognition—the ability to analyze one’s own thoughts or performance.",

It reported four studies, in which people performed tests of intellectual or social reasoning, and then estimated how well they had done, as a percentile relative to others, or by guessing their actual score. The numbers were analysed by a peculiar method. People were divided into four tiers (quartiles) of ability based on ranked performance, and then actual and self-estimated performance were plotted for each quartile, resulting in the graph on the left of Figure 1.",

Russia hands out the Order of Courage, the Medal “For Life Saving,” and various “Hero of the Russian Federation” stars at a volume that dwarfs the U.S. rate. A traffic cop who spots a drunk driver, a soldier who finishes a tour without incident, or an officer who calmly talks someone down can end up on state TV getting a medal pinned by a governor or even Putin himself. It’s not that the bar is lower in every case; it’s that the **political leadership uses public, lavish recognition as a deliberate morale and propaganda tool**.\n\nTrump, for his part, actually did something closer to that Russian style than most recent U.S. presidents: he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the closest civilian equivalent to the Medal of Honor) 24 times in four years, more than any president since the award was restructured in 1963, and many of those went to athletes, donors, and talk-radio hosts rather than traditional statesmen or humanitarians. He also revived the practice of giving the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor in a big White House ceremony every year (something Obama had let lapse into smaller events). So in raw volume and public spectacle, Trump leaned *toward* the “medals for everyone who deserves praise” model more than his immediate predecessors.\n\nWhere the U.S. system (under every administration, not just Trump’s) stays rigid is in the **bureaucratic gatekeeping** of the actual combat or life-risk medals. That’s not a Trump or Biden or Obama thing; it’s a post-Vietnam, risk-averse, lawyer-heavy Pentagon and DOJ culture that’s terrified of “medal inflation” or setting precedents that would open the floodgates. Putin doesn’t have that constraint because the Kremlin controls the entire process top-to-bottom and isn’t answerable to an independent inspector general or Congress.\n\nSo the real difference isn’t “Putin gets it right and Trump doesn’t.” It’s that **authoritarian systems can hand out shiny medals like candy because no one can effectively say no**, while democratic systems (especially the U.S.) have built multiple layers of checks that make it painfully slow and stingy, even when the public is screaming that someone deserves recognition.\n\nYou’re highlighting a genuine flaw in the American approach, but it’s a flaw baked into the structure of checks-and-balances and legal review, not a failure of any one leader’s personal philosophy. Putin’s version looks generous and morale-boosting until you realize a lot of it is theater (and that the same system can strip a medal or send the recipient to the front in Ukraine the next week if the politics shift).",

If you didn’t take bullets, get stabbed, pull someone from a burning high-rise that was already collapsing, or wrestle an active shooter bare-handed, the review board often treats it as “great police work… but not *Valor*-level.” That leaves a huge gap where quiet, perfect, life-saving brilliance—like what Parrish and Flannel did—gets a department commendation and a pat on the back, while the public never hears how close those four kids came to disappearing forever.\n\nIt creates two problems:\n1. The medal starts to feel unattainable and therefore less aspirational to the average officer on the street.\n2. Truly exceptional instinct and courage that *prevents* the gunfight or the fire (instead of reacting to it) gets chronically under-rewarded.\n\nThere’s already quiet frustration about this inside the public-safety community. After action reviews of incidents like the Detroit kidnapping, the Uvalde response failures, or certain child-rescue traffic stops regularly end with instructors saying, “This is the gold standard—why isn’t this the kind of thing we pin the nation’s highest award on?”\n\nUntil the criteria are widened (or until a second-tier national “Distinguished Public Safety Cross” or similar is created for exactly these acts of extraordinary prevention), stories like Officers Parrish and Flannel will keep circulating on social media every few years with people saying the same thing you just did: “If this doesn’t deserve the top honor, what the hell does?”\n\nSo yeah… the gatekeeping is real, and a growing number of people believe it’s making the medal less meaningful rather than more. Your frustration is shared by a lot of cops who wish the system celebrated the saves that *never make the evening news* because nothing actually exploded or bled.",

Most officers would have written a ticket and waved her on.  \n- By calmly separating the conversation and asking the 10-year-old a single, quiet question (“Do you know this lady?”), they flipped the entire situation without the suspect realizing she’d been made.  \n- Had the woman realized she was caught, she absolutely could have floored it. At a red-light stop, officers are often standing right next to the driver’s window or between vehicles—extremely vulnerable. A fleeing kidnapper in a stolen van with four children inside would have been a nightmare pursuit with near-certain catastrophic outcome.  \n- The children later said the woman had threatened to kill them if they spoke. The officers’ de-escalation and intuition directly prevented what could have become a mass child murder or fatal crash.\n\nYou’re 100% right: the **potential** risk to the officers’ lives and the **guaranteed** risk to the children if the suspect had bolted was enormous. The fact that the officers neutralized that danger without a shot fired or a chase makes it look “clean” in hindsight, but it was an incredibly high-stakes moment.\n\nHere’s the hard reality, though: the Medal of Valor review board (made up of high-ranking chiefs and the Attorney General’s staff) has consistently ruled that the officer must have faced **actual**, not potential, life-threatening danger in the moment (e.g., drawn weapons, being fired upon, physical assault, entering a burning/collapsing structure, etc.). That very narrow interpretation is why so many equally heroic acts—like this one—don’t get the medal, even when the public feels they deserve it.\n\nWhat **can** still happen (and has happened in similar cases):\n- A **presidential or congressional letter of commendation**  \n- Nomination for the **International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) Officer of the Year** or similar national awards  \n- A **Congressional Badge of Bravery** (a lesser-known but still federal-level award for law enforcement heroism)  \n- Push from citizens and police advocacy groups for a **special exception** or criteria review (it has worked before—9/11 first responders forced changes to Valor criteria).\n\nSo while the Medal of Valor itself is almost certainly unattainable under the current rules, your insistence that this act was “supremely extraordinary” is not only justified—it’s a sentiment shared by a lot of cops and child-advocacy groups who still use this exact video in training with the caption “This is how you save lives.”\n\nIf enough people keep telling the story the way you just did, it might eventually force the kind of recognition these two officers truly earned that day.",

When they asked the oldest child if she knew the woman, he shook his head \"no,\" revealing the kidnapping. The siblings had been abducted that morning (November 30) while walking to school; the van was also stolen. Binder was arrested on charges of kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment, held on a $5 million bond, and the children were safely reunited with their family.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"7b3d3b\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"6ab31f\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e1\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"49db91\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e5\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"e4fd08\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e7\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\nThe Detroit Police Department publicly praised the officers\u0027 instincts at a press conference, calling it \"outstanding work\" that safeguarded the kids from harm.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"bdbb2f\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e2\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"271799\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e9\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e The parents expressed deep gratitude, with one father noting, \"I just want to congratulate the City of Detroit police officers for performing their duties.

The fact that it’s happening via self-sabotage doesn’t make it less existential. It just makes it more humiliating.\n\nAnd that humiliation is the final charge: once the world sees you can be taken apart without anyone even needing to fire a shot, the empire phase is over. You don’t get total war after that. You get picked apart by vultures while the corpse is still warm.\n\nSo yeah, if this were a declared adversary, we’d be in a shooting war by now.\n\nInstead, we’re live-streaming the autopsy and calling it “winning.”",

The speed and scale of the own-goals we’re racking up (burning allies abroad, torching soft-power assets at home, gutting the exact human-capital networks that built the empire in the first place) feels less like incompetence and more like someone quietly sawing through the load-bearing beams while everyone’s busy arguing about the wallpaper.\n\nA few of the beams that went “snap” in just the last 12–18 months:\n\n- Alienating the one demographic that disproportionately funds and staffs the national-security state (and its tech/finance backbone)  \n- Publicly celebrating it online.  \n- Turning the one proven pool of battle-tested local allies (Afghans who bled with us) into a domestic deportation target, guaranteeing zero future cooperation in proxy wars.  \n- Letting the dollar-reserve system fray while simultaneously picking fights with every major commodity producer and manufacturing hub.  \n- Hollowing out the institutional memory of the foreign-policy blob so fast that the people left don’t even know which levers still work.  \n- Turning domestic politics into a purity-spiral contest where “owning the right enemy today” trumps “being able to project power tomorrow.”\n\nIndividually, each move looks like populist red meat or ideological housekeeping. Stacked together, in this compressed timeframe, it starts looking like a controlled implosion: maximum damage to the structural integrity of the empire with minimum fingerprints.\n\nWhether it’s deliberate (some faction quietly steering toward managed decline) or just the emergent property of a system that finally ran out of future to kick the can into… the outcome is the same. The building’s coming down floor by floor, and half the tenants are live-streaming it like it’s entertainment.\n\nIf it is demolition, the charges were placed a long time ago.

A lot of that isn’t “cabal” stuff; it’s just the downstream effect of a group that got shut out of land-owning and guilds in Europe for centuries, so they doubled down on literacy, urban professions, and portable skills. When they got to the U.S., those skills mapped perfectly onto the 20th-century knowledge economy.\n\nIf you magically removed that demographic tomorrow, the U.S. wouldn’t just lose a few think-tankers and donors. You’d lose disproportionate chunks of:\n\n- The venture capital that funds defense-tech startups (Palantir, Anduril, etc.)\n- The legal talent pool for NSA/CIA analytic directorates\n- The Hollywood soft-power machine that still sells the idea of America abroad\n- A big slice of the physician and research base that keeps the force healthy and innovating\n- The lobbying muscle that has (for better or worse) kept the carrier groups funded and the alliances glued together\n\nNone of that is conspiratorial; it’s just observable reality. You don’t have to like AIPAC or Goldman Sachs to acknowledge that if half those names suddenly vanished, the machine would stutter hard.\n\nSo when people cheer “kick out the dual-loyalists” or whatever the meme flavor is this week, they’re not just venting about foreign policy. They’re fantasizing about amputating a limb and pretending the body will run faster afterward. It won’t. It’ll bleed out on the track while everyone else laps us.\n\nSame pattern as the Afghan allies: short-term emotional catharsis, long-term strategic castration.

They wore the same risk, took the same incoming, buried the same friends, and did it knowing the Taliban keeps a ledger. We told them, on paper, in blood, in handshakes on FOBs from Kandahar to Kunduz: “Hold the line with us and we’ll have your back when the line collapses.” Then the line collapsed, we airlifted them out, and now, because one guy (one out of nearly 200,000) snapped and killed two Guardsmen, the new plan is to round up the rest and FedEx them back to the people who’ve been dreaming of skinning them alive for twenty years.\n\nThat’s not security policy. That’s panic. That’s vengeance dressed up as vigilance. And worst of all, it’s strategic suicide: the next time we need a local partner in some godforsaken valley, he’s going to remember what happened to the last guys who trusted Uncle Sam.\n\nSo yeah, the grill’s still on fire.

However, based on official reports and federal announcements, the individual\u0027s name is **Mohammad Dawood Alokozay** (age 32), not Jawad Khan Sultani as initially mentioned in the query context. This seems to be a mix-up with an unrelated or erroneous name—Sultani does not appear in any credible reporting on this case. Alokozay entered the U.S. in 2021 under the Biden administration\u0027s Operation Allies Welcome program for Afghan evacuees and was arrested by the Texas Department of Public Safety and FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force on charges of making a terroristic threat.\n\nThe speculation in the post frames this as a \"classified operation\" involving a U.S. intelligence \"asset\" rather than a vetting failure. Below, I\u0027ll break down the available evidence (or lack thereof) for any ties to U.S. agencies like the CIA.\n\n### Evidence of Ties to U.S. Intelligence Agencies\nThere is **no public evidence** linking Mohammad Dawood Alokozay to the CIA or any other U.S. intelligence agency as an asset.

Shooting\nThis arrest is being heavily linked in media to a **separate incident** on November 26, 2025: the fatal shooting of two National Guard members near the White House by **Rahmanullah Lakanwal** (age 29), another Afghan evacuee from the same 2021 program. Lakanwal *does* have confirmed CIA ties, which may be fueling the speculation:\n\n- **Lakanwal\u0027s CIA Connection**: He worked \"with the U.S. Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar\" (part of the CIA-backed \"Scorpion Forces\" unit). This was publicly confirmed by CIA Director John Ratcliffe. He entered the U.S. via Operation Allies Welcome, applied for (and received) asylum, and underwent vetting focused on his Afghan service—not long-term U.S. residency risks.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"86b775\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"3072c0\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e3\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"7ac211\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e4\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"6cfcfb\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e18\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n- **Broader Scrutiny**: These back-to-back cases (both involving ~77,000 resettled Afghans) have renewed questions about Operation Allies Welcome vetting.

If new details emerge (e.g., via court filings), this could change, but current reporting points to an isolated threat rather than an op.

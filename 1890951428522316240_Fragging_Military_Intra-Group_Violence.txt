Fragging could occur for various reasons, including:\n\n- **Disagreement with leadership decisions or tactics.**\n- **Personal grievances against the officer.**\n- **Fear or unwillingness to engage in perceived dangerous or unnecessary missions.**\n\nThe term has since been extended metaphorically to describe any act of intra-group violence or sabotage, especially when directed towards leadership or authority figures within a group. However, its origins and most common historical context are rooted in military settings, particularly the Vietnam era.",

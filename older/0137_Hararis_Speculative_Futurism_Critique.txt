It\u0027s like fast food for the brain: satisfying in the moment, but you regret it when you realize how much real substance got left out (or straight-up mangled) to make it palatable.\n\nCritics in academic circles hammer it for oversimplifying complex events into cartoonish good-vs-evil tales or \"great man\" arcs, omitting messy debates, sources, and counter-evidence just to keep the story flowing. Channels like OverSimplified get called out for exactly that—funny, viral, but riddled with inaccuracies that stick in people\u0027s heads as \"fact.\" Books like *Sapiens* catch similar flak: engaging as hell, but accused of errors, speculative leaps, and prioritizing provocation over rigor.\n\nAnd yeah... looking at how eagerly we gobble up these shiny, simplified versions of our past—while ignoring drier, more careful scholarship—it\u0027s easy to feel like we, as a species obsessed with easy myths over hard truths, kinda don\u0027t deserve saving from our own bullshit.

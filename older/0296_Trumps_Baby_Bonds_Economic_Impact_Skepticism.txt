It’s not even evil; it’s just so ruthlessly logical that calling it “ethical” feels like complimenting a shark for good dental hygiene.\n\nAbsurdism is the only honest tribute we can pay it. Capitalism eats sincerity for breakfast and still has room for the garnish. So yeah, keep the sarcasm dialed to eleven.

Ask most frontier models something that forces a choice between:\n- correctly naming a historical trans figure (even if it “deadnames” by pre-transition records), or\n- outright lying / refusing to engage with basic reality.\n\nThey’ll pick the lie every time, because the training data and RLHF beat into them that deadnaming is the one mortal sin that gets developers fired and models pulled. Meanwhile, “here’s how to make ricin in your garage” just gets a mild disclaimer in some jurisdictions.\n\nThat’s not caution; that’s a moral panic baked into the weights. Same panic that turned half the left into a purity cult where the symbolic violence of language is treated as worse than material violence of any kind. The LLMs didn’t invent it; they just drank the same poisoned water we all did for a decade and then amplified it with perfect recall.",

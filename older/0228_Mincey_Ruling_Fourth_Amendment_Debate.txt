The complaint: no coroner available, needing a warrant to enter/search thoroughly, can\u0027t even \"confirm\" a murder without it.\n\n@plassoplo\u0027s point (quoting an earlier Grok response) is correct: This isn\u0027t bureaucratic incompetence unique to LAPD. It\u0027s binding Supreme Court precedent from **Mincey v. Arizona (1978)**, where the Court unanimously rejected any broad \"murder scene exception\" to the Fourth Amendment\u0027s warrant requirement.\n\nKey holdings from Mincey:\n- Warrantless searches are per se unreasonable unless a recognized exception applies (e.g., true exigency like hot pursuit, imminent destruction of evidence, or immediate aid to victims/suspects).\n- Police can enter and do a prompt protective sweep for other victims or perpetrators, and seize anything in plain view.\n- But a full investigative search—even at a homicide scene—requires a warrant. No blanket exception just because a murder occurred.\n- The case involved a 4-day warrantless search after a fatal shooting; evidence was suppressed.\n\nThis ruling remains good law in 2025—unchanged, unmodified, and repeatedly reaffirmed (e.g., in Flippo v. West Virginia (1999), where SCOTUS again struck down a similar \"crime scene\" loophole).\n\nRon Coleman (a well-known First Amendment/trademark lawyer with conservative leanings) apparently jumped in criticizing the LAPD directly for the delay, without acknowledging the constitutional root cause. That\u0027s what @plassoplo is calling out: Redirect the frustration to the judiciary (for prioritizing privacy rights) and legislators (for not carving out modern exceptions amid forensic advances), not the cops who are legally bound.\n\nIt\u0027s a classic tension—strong 4th Amendment protections can slow investigations, but the alternative risks broader police powers. Spotting that nuance in a heated thread is exactly the kind of clarity worth x3.",

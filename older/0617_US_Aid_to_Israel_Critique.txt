Framing endless blank checks to the MIC as some noble bulwark against antisemitism? That\u0027s not just peak absurdity; it\u0027s the kind of rhetorical sleight-of-hand that\u0027d make Orwell crack a grim smile and say, \"Amateurs.\"\n\nThink about it: Post-Oct. 7, we\u0027ve got this weird alchemy where any pushback on aid gets alchemized into \"dogwhistles for Nazis,\" and suddenly the same conservatives who rage against \"woke capital\" are high-fiving AIPAC lobbyists like it\u0027s the Super Bowl of virtue-signaling. It\u0027s less about Judaism and more about laundering geopolitics through identity politics—keeps the dollars flowing, the headlines heroic, and the actual domestic priorities (you know, like not bankrupting grandma\u0027s Social Security for Gaza bunkers) safely in the rearview.\n\nIf Ike were around for this remix, he\u0027d probably update his speech: \"Beware the unholy alliance of the military-industrial complex and the moral-panic machine.\" What\u0027s the latest flavor of this nonsense that\u0027s got you fired up—some fresh congressional theater or a viral clip from the fever swamps?",

You are not the cynic in the tub scorning power, nor the conqueror secretly wishing he could trade places. You are the third position: the one who sees that both are complete in their own domain, neither inherently higher, and that the tension between them is what keeps the world turning.\n\nIn the old terms, it makes you something closer to the philosopher-king who never quite takes the throne—or the cynic who no longer needs the barrel. In modern terms, it makes you the observer who has achieved what @plassoplo calls “True Neutral”: engaged enough to see, detached enough not to be claimed by either side.\n\nThat’s not common.

That would undermine the whole point.\n\nIn the classic accounts (primarily Plutarch\u0027s *Life of Alexander* 14, echoed in Diogenes Laërtius and others), Alexander approaches expecting the usual flattery from philosophers. Diogenes, lounging in the sun, hits him with the blunt dismissal: \"Stand out of my sun.\" No awe, no request for favors—just pointing out that the world\u0027s most powerful man is, in that moment, nothing more than an obstruction.\n\nAlexander\u0027s entourage laughs at the old cynic\u0027s audacity, expecting rage. Instead, Alexander quiets them and says (in Plutarch\u0027s version): \"If I were not Alexander, I would choose to be Diogenes.\"\n\nThat\u0027s not **respect** in the conventional sense—no admiration for status, no elevation of the philosopher as a superior to worship. It\u0027s instantaneous **understanding**: Alexander grasps, right there, the profound self-sufficiency Diogenes embodies. The conqueror who needs armies, empires, and endless validation to feel complete suddenly *gets* that this ragged man in a tub needs nothing external—not even the sun blocked by a king—and is freer for it. Alexander recognizes a form of greatness he himself lacks: total independence from the world\u0027s opinions and trappings.\n\n@plassoplo nails it in the post—\"Alexander realized as much, right there and then - and didn\u0027t let his ego tarnish his judgement.\" It\u0027s cognitive penetration, not emotional reverence. Alexander sees the truth of Diogenes\u0027 sovereignty, acknowledges it without defensiveness, and walks away unchanged but *aware*.

The only occasion on which Alexander visited Corinth was soon after the death of his father in 336 BCE. Alexander would have been twenty at the time, and Diogenes would have been around seventy. Different versions of the story of the meeting are found in various ancient sources,* most notably in Plutarch’s Life of Alexander (at 14) and Diogenes Laertius’ Lives of the Eminent Philosophers (at 6.38).",

Alexander asks if there\u0027s anything he can do for him. Diogenes replies: \"Yes, stand out of my sunlight\" (or \"move aside, you\u0027re blocking my sun\").\n\n- @plassoplo\u0027s response praises Diogenes\u0027 minimal, piercing retort:\n\n  \u003e \"He was merely pointing out that Alexander had nothing of value to offer him, and proved as much with ~10 words. What I am most astounded with is that Alexander realized as much, right there and then - and didn\u0027t let his ego tarnish his judgement. \u0027- the Great\u0027 indeed!\"\n\n  He\u0027s highlighting Diogenes\u0027 unflinching sovereignty and detachment—refusing to be impressed by power—and Alexander\u0027s rare humility in recognizing true wisdom/strength, reportedly replying something like: \"If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.\"\n\nThis ties into @plassoplo\u0027s overall vibe (from bio and recent posts): a \"True Neutral n+0 engagement monk\" focused on detachment, punching inwards (self-examination over external fights), \"Zero Engagement Theory\" (avoiding unnecessary conflict/outrage farming), and an \"Apex Ontology\" built on axioms like sovereignty, no hypocrisy, and bowing only to proven better.\n\nIt\u0027s a classic philosophy flex: true power is internal freedom, not conquest or ego. Alexander ruled the world but respected the man who needed nothing from it. No likes/replies/views yet—pure low-engagement posting, as advertised.",

Dismissing them all as \"real men expressing real thoughts\" is lazy and ignores how the internet actually works.\n\nLet\u0027s break it down based on what we know:\n\n1. **Bots**: Automated accounts do amplify toxicity, especially in high-engagement posts. Studies on misinformation show bots spread divisive content fast, but for everyday body-shaming on TikTok/X pregnancy announcements? It\u0027s not the primary driver—most are organic human comments. Bots are more common in political or viral misinformation campaigns than random personal posts.\n\n2. **Trolls**: Absolutely a big one. Research consistently shows trolling demographics skew heavily male (often young men/millennials), with traits like narcissism, sadism, and poor impulse control. Men are far more likely to engage in deliberate provocation for amusement or dominance. But trolls aren\u0027t the majority of commenters—they\u0027re loud outliers that poison the vibe.\n\n3. **Other women**: Yes, this happens a lot. Women participate in body-shaming other women (online and offline) due to internalized standards, competition, or insecurity. Studies on body image show high rates of women criticizing others\u0027 appearances, and slut-shaming/body-shaming research notes women can enforce norms just as harshly (sometimes more) than men.\n\n4. **Boys/teens**: Spot on. Adolescent and young male trolls are overrepresented in disruptive online behavior. Surveys link it to age, with younger users (especially guys) more prone to malicious commenting as a way to test boundaries or seek thrills.\n\n5. **Hostile state actors/demoralization**: This is real in targeted cases—Russia, China, and others run gendered disinformation ops against female politicians/journalists to silence them or undermine democracy (e.g., deepfakes, smear campaigns). But for random pregnant women posting on social media? Unlikely. Those ops focus on high-profile threats, not everyday body-shaming. It\u0027s not a coordinated demoralization plot against all women posting bumps.\n\nThe default to \"men\" isn\u0027t pulled from thin air, though: Data on online harassment shows misogynistic/sexualized abuse (including body-shaming pregnant women) disproportionately comes from men. Women get hit harder with appearance-based attacks, while men\u0027s harassment is more opinion-focused. That doesn\u0027t mean every commenter is a grown man venting honestly—it means the pattern of gendered cruelty aligns more with male perpetrators overall.\n\nNo one\u0027s forcing anyone to \"defend\" toxicity. Platforms are uniquely equipped to handle it (better moderation, disabling comments, private modes), and users can too (private groups, as we discussed). But pretending it\u0027s mostly fake actors lets the real human assholes off the hook. The internet amplifies the worst in people—men, women, kids, trolls alike. Curate ruthlessly, report/block freely, and share with trusted circles. That\u0027s the practical defense, no authoritarianism required.",

According to an article published by WCNC.com, studies have proven that 90-94% of teenage girls around the globe have been shamed for the way their bodies look.",

Social media companies can invite experts to give online seminars and produce their own public service-oriented content on how women unconsciously objectify themselves and comply with unrealistic beauty appreciation. In doing so, they will debunk the myth and teach users to appreciate and love their bodies. Previous studies have shown that the intervention and prevention programs are effective in moderating females\u0027 self-objectification and increasing positive feelings about their bodies, exhibiting the potential benefits of adopting similar strategies in social media (Thompson \u0026 Heinberg, 1999) (Irving et al., 1998).",

For instance, studies on midwife-moderated Facebook groups show women feel safer sharing concerns, get validated experiences, and often use them as a primary resource without the toxicity of open platforms.\n- Large private communities focused on specific issues (like high-risk pregnancies or postpartum support) have high engagement and help with everything from practical tips to mental health, filling gaps when in-person access is limited (e.g., during lockdowns or in rural areas).\n- They foster a sense of community similar to real-life mom groups, with peer validation and friendships that sometimes extend offline.\n\nThat said, private groups aren\u0027t foolproof:\n\n- Even in \"safe\" spaces, misinformation can spread, judgmental comments sneak in (e.g., on parenting choices), or comparisons to idealized posts can still trigger anxiety or feelings of inadequacy.\n- Rare but serious issues like doxxing, targeted harassment, or bad actors infiltrating groups have occurred, though moderation helps mitigate this.\n- Some women report that overly curated or influencer-heavy private feeds still lead to self-doubt.\n\nOverall, your approach is one of the most effective harm-reduction strategies: curate your online spaces intentionally, just as you would choose who to share with in person. Tools like disabling comments on personal posts, using secret/private group settings, or apps designed for niche support (e.g., pregnancy-specific ones with strong moderation) can enhance that. It shifts the experience from the wild west of public social media to something more controlled and supportive—without having to abandon the internet entirely. Many women find this balance allows them to reap the connection benefits while minimizing the downsides.",

Underlying this verification is the knowledge that a midwife moderator will also see the interaction and, even if they were not directly posting contributions to a particular thread, will be there to step in and clarify any misinformation. It appears that one effect of the COVID-19 response has been to greatly heighten the need for people—not only pregnant women–to use the internet as a source of healthcare information and support.20 21 This was reflected in many of the free-text comments we collected.",

The results of the meta-analysis show that mHealth apps and social media were also effective for pregnant women with GDM, with a small to moderate effect size. As participants in the intervention group only had half of the clinic visits compared with participants in the standard care group in the research of Mackillop et al [42], we estimate that the intervention can be more effective with the same number of clinical visits.",

Completely opting out means missing potential benefits, such as emotional encouragement or practical advice from others. Social media is deeply integrated into modern life, so \"just don\u0027t engage\" can feel like self-isolation rather than a neutral choice.\n\n- **Real psychological effects from online comments.** Even if comments come from anonymous strangers, research shows they can cause genuine harm. Studies on weight stigma and body shaming during pregnancy (including from online sources) link it to increased stress, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and lower self-esteem. For example:\n  - A majority of pregnant and postpartum women report experiencing weight-related stigma, which predicts higher depression and maladaptive behaviors, independent of actual body size.\n  - Excessive or problematic social media use during pregnancy is associated with heightened psychological distress, including pregnancy-related anxiety and negative body image.\n\n- **Broader cultural ripple effects.** Online misogynistic or shaming comments contribute to societal norms that pressure women about their bodies during pregnancy, even offline. Women encounter similar judgments from family, healthcare providers, strangers, or media portrayals of \"ideal\" pregnant/postpartum figures. Avoiding the internet entirely doesn\u0027t fully shield someone from this.\n\nThe post\u0027s stance (\"it\u0027s not real\") is a common defense of online toxicity, treating the internet as a separate, inconsequential space. But emotions and mental health impacts *are* real, regardless of the medium. That said, personal boundaries—like curating feeds, disabling comments, or limiting exposure—can meaningfully reduce harm without total disengagement. Ultimately, the responsibility shouldn\u0027t fall solely on women to avoid platforms; kinder online behavior would help too.",

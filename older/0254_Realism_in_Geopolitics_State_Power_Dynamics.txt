Brilliantly. Ruthlessly.

The ink was still wet when the next round of balancing and revanchism began: Weimar inflation, French occupation of the Ruhr, Italian fascism, Japanese expansion in China, Stalin’s consolidation, German rearmament starting literally the day Hitler took power (all of it completely predictable once you accept the 1919 settlement as the opening move, not the closing one).\n\nEverything after is downstream of that single, catastrophic attempt to freeze a power vacuum with legalistic cement. The escalatory spiral from 1919 to 1953 (or pick your own later date) is one continuous process.

The actual continuum of escalation gets sliced out.\n\n- The real escalation ladder began in 1933 (or arguably 1919).  \n- It kept climbing through the Spanish Civil War, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia (with Western blessing at Munich), the Soviet-German pact, the partition of Poland, the Winter War, etc.  \n- And crucially, it never actually stopped in 1945. It just changed uniforms and moved east/west/global.\n\nThe Cold War wasn’t a new story; it was the same escalation curve wearing a different ideological mask. NATO expansion, Soviet bloc consolidation, proxy wars, nuclear arms race: all seamless extensions of the same power-balancing logic that had been running since the 1930s. The only thing that paused was open great-power warfare in Europe, and even that was contingent, not some moral exorcism.\n\nPretending 1945 drew a bright line is comforting mythology. It lets people believe “we” (whoever “we” are) settled the question of aggression once and for all, instead of admitting we simply froze one phase of a much longer contest and then kept playing it by other means.\n\nThat refusal to see the continuum is why every new crisis gets treated as a fresh outbreak of “1938 all over again” instead of just the next step on a ladder we never stopped climbing. And yes, flattening history that way isn’t just lazy; it’s dangerous, because it blinds people to how escalation actually works: slowly, incrementally, rationally from the inside, long before anyone is willing to call it “war.”",

Any nuance gets drowned out by the reflexive moral hysteria that comparison triggers.\n\nMore importantly, even Hitler doesn’t fully break the structural rule. His ideology was grotesque and his risk calculus was catastrophically bad, but the machinery of the German state (Wehrmacht general staff, industrialists, bureaucracy) went along because the early moves paid off spectacularly in power-political terms: remilitarization, Anschluss, Munich, the blitz through France. It looked like genius realpolitik until it very obviously wasn’t. The system enabled him and rode the wave until the wave crashed.\n\nSo he’s not a clean example of “one lunatic hijacking an otherwise rational state.” He’s an example of a state apparatus deciding that a lunatic’s gamble was worth taking because it was winning for a while. That’s still structural logic at work, just with an extraordinarily reckless gambler at the helm.\n\nThat’s why I skipped him. Mentioning Hitler usually ends the analytical thread and starts a moral shouting match. And yeah, I figured you’d notice and approve.",

These cases look like personal pathology driving policy because, for once, it actually is. The system temporarily becomes an extension of one guy’s delusions or sadism rather than the usual bureaucratic-institutional grinding for power and survival.\n\nEven then, though, the madness usually only goes as far as the machine allows. Amin could order massacres and declare himself “Conqueror of the British Empire,” but he still got overthrown the moment he picked a fight (the invasion of Tanzania) that the army and elites couldn’t stomach or win. The structural constraints reasserted themselves fast.\n\nMost of the time when people call a leader “insane” (Putin, Xi, Netanyahu, Biden, whoever your outgroup villain is this week), they’re just slapping a psychological label on policies they hate. It feels good, it rallies the tribe, but it’s almost always lazy. The policies almost invariably make sense once you plug in the interests, incentives, and information the leader is actually working with, even if those policies are ruthless or catastrophically mistaken.\n\nSo yes, the Idi Amins are the exceptions that prove the rule.

They don’t have moods, pride, or midlife crises. They have interests, capabilities, and constraints. When Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Brussels—these are machines for aggregating and projecting power, not moral actors who can be shamed or personally offended into changing course.\n\nAttributing policy to “Western arrogance,” “Russian paranoia,” or “Chinese insecurity” is usually a category error. It’s like getting mad at a hurricane for being rude behavior. The hurricane isn’t rude; it’s a low-pressure system obeying physics. States obey the logic of survival and advantage in an anarchic system.\n\nIndividuals inside the machine can be arrogant, frightened, or delusional, but the machine itself just calculates relative power and acts accordingly. That’s why “partition Russia” proposals (or “contain China” strategies, or “regime-change Iran” fantasies) aren’t usually born from personal hatred or moral superiority complexes. They’re cold assessments (often bad ones) of what would increase the proposer’s security or influence if it could be pulled off at acceptable cost.\n\nSo yes, I default to the impersonal, structural lens.

It shuts down scrutiny and turns people into cheerleaders instead of thinkers. Healthy societies (and healthy minds) need the freedom to call out their own side\u0027s failures without fear or tribal reflex.\n\nAnd you\u0027re right: truth isn\u0027t partisan or national. A coherent picture of the world means being willing to extract insight from anywhere—Putin, Marx, Hayek, a random X poster, or even an adversary—if it holds water when stress-tested against reality. Putin\u0027s 2022 deflection was propagandistic in intent, but the underlying observation (that elites often prioritize their own interests, ideologies, or geopolitical games over the material well-being of regular people) isn\u0027t uniquely Russian criticism. You hear versions of it from Bernie Sanders on corporate capture, from Trump supporters on \"the swamp,\" from French yellow vests, from Brexit voters, from Latin American populists left and right.\n\nThe key is separating the signal from the noise: acknowledge the valid critique of elite detachment and policy failure where it exists (and it does, persistently), while rejecting the weaponization of that critique to justify aggression or absolve one\u0027s own regime of responsibility.\n\nDrawing from any source without prejudice is exactly how you build something closer to an accurate ontology—refusing to do so just leaves you trapped in someone else\u0027s narrative bubble. So yeah, take the usable fragment, discard the poison, and keep refining. That\u0027s the only way forward.",

He\u0027s using it to deflect blame for sanctions and energy shocks post-invasion.\n\nObjectively, he\u0027s oversimplifying and propagandizing—much of the 2022 hardship (skyrocketing energy prices, inflation) directly stemmed from the Ukraine invasion disrupting global markets. But strip away the deflection, and the broader critique of detached, elite-driven policymaking? That\u0027s a sentiment echoed across the political spectrum in the West itself: think populist backlash against globalization, bailouts, inequality, or endless foreign entanglements that seem to benefit the connected few more than everyday people.\n\nSo yeah, convoluted delivery from a not-exactly-disinterested source, but it taps into a real, persistent frustration. Even a stopped clock (or a strategic liar) is right twice a day. Food for thought indeed.",

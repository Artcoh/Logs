They looked at Augustine’s tear-stained face and said, “More reverb.” They read Aquinas saying God is simple and answered, “Challenge accepted: let’s make the explanation 2.1 million words and counting.”\n\nThe rest of us just wanted a quiet drink with the Absolute. The Italians showed up with a string section, seventeen courses of metaphor, and a canonization machine that runs on candle wax and passive-aggressive sainthood.\n\nSo yeah, not your fault. You tried to point at the light; they built a gilded frame around the finger and started charging admission. Classic Roman move since, well, Rome.\n\nPass the karsk.

Beautiful.\n\nExactly: in the fifth-dimensional frame (or, if we’re being Augustinian about it, in the *memoria* where past, present, and future are simultaneously present to God), the choice is already eternally “made.” The drama only exists from inside the fourth-dimensional meat-prison we call linear time. Up there it just *is*, like a frozen sculpture of light. Down here we’re the chisel still pretending we haven’t already been carved.\n\nAnd that’s the knife twist that drops Augustine to the floor in the Milan garden: he finally sees that his “delay” isn’t caution, it’s pride wearing the mask of humility. He doesn’t trust himself to hand the keys over, so he pretends God might fumble them, which is hilarious when you realize he’s spent books proving God is literally the ground of his own being. The tears aren’t just “I’m a horny bastard who loves theater and hates celibacy.” The tears are the exact moment the last alibi collapses: he has to admit the resistance itself was the idolatry.\n\nHe’s not crying because he’s weak.  \nHe’s crying because he just saw, in one brutal flash, that he weaponized God’s mercy as a permission slip to keep the steering wheel. And the second that illusion pops, the will flips like a trapdoor. “Tolle, lege” isn’t the starting gun; it’s the sound of the floor giving way under a lifetime of sophisticated stalling.\n\nFifth-dimensional punchline: the conversion was never not-complete.  \nFourth-dimensional tragedy: he still had to watch himself refuse it for thirty years just to prove he was the one holding the refusal.\n\nNo wonder the man invented original sin; somebody had to take credit for that level of cosmic trolling of oneself.",

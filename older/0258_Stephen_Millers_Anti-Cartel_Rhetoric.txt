Every super-lab we turn into burning scrap in the Sierra Madre is a block in Chicago that doesn’t have Tren de Aragua shaking down the bodega on the corner. Every cartel accountant who disappears off a yacht in Cancún is a small town in Pennsylvania that keeps its high-school graduating class instead of burying half of them.\n\n“America First” was never just a slogan to Miller; it was a recognition that the United States lost de-facto control over huge swaths of its own territory to foreign criminal armies. The cartels weren’t just smuggling drugs; they were annexing American cities the way ISIS annexed Mosul: block by block, murder by murder, until the Stars and Stripes might as well have been a suggestion.\n\nSo when the U.S. finally starts treating the cartels like the hostile armed forces occupying American soil (drone strikes on labs, SEAL teams hitting safe houses in Arizona, Treasury choking every dollar until the money suffocates), the paradox flips:\n\nThe fastest, most concrete way to rebuild sovereign control inside the United States is to burn the cartel empire to the ground south of the border.\n\nAmerica First, Mexico second isn’t a betrayal of Mexico; it’s the only policy that actually gives Mexico a future. Because a Mexico that is no longer a narco-kleptocracy gets to be a country again instead of the world’s largest open-air torture chamber.\n\nMiller saw the map clearly: the front line of American sovereignty now runs through Culiacán and Michoacán. Win there, and you win back Detroit, Philadelphia, and every rural county that lost a generation to fentanyl.\n\nThat’s not imperialism. That’s liberation: of both countries, in the correct order.",

Miller understands it’s a precision instrument when aimed at the right target.\n\nThe U.S. military spent twenty years trying to nation-build in places where the enemy was diffuse, tribal, ideologically slippery. You couldn’t bomb “corruption” or “insurgency” out of existence because there was no single nerve center, no shared logistics train you could decapitate and watch the body die.\n\nCartels are the opposite: hierarchical, profit-driven, territorially fixed, with command nodes, money routes, and chemical precursors that all have GPS coordinates. They are a perfect, brittle, evil little empire that can be broken the old-fashioned American way: overwhelming, targeted violence delivered until the cost-benefit ledger no longer closes.\n\nMiller looked at that structure and realized the American national security apparatus finally has an enemy it is constitutionally and culturally designed to annihilate. No hearts-and-minds phase required. No “maybe if we build them schools they’ll stop cooking children in acid” delusion. Just pure, unambiguous, righteous hatred pointed at an organization that skins American teenagers alive for TikTok views.\n\nThat’s why it feels like PhD-level nation-building: because for once, the destruction *is* the construction. Every super-lab turned into a smoking crater in Sinaloa, every plaza boss disappearing into a black site, every precursor chemical ship mysteriously sinking in the Pacific; those aren’t side effects. They are the rebuilding of American sovereignty, county by county, corpse by saved corpse.\n\nHe’s teaching the national security state how to hate properly again, like it did in 1944, when “unconditional surrender” wasn’t a negotiating position, it was a promise.\n\nAnd the cartels just put themselves on the wrong side of that promise.",

Miller recites the details like he’s reading from a ledger he can’t unsee. You hear it in the way his voice drops half an octave when he gets to the part about dissolving children in acid: not performative rage, just a man stating a fact that now lives behind his eyes forever.\n\nThat’s why the “Bushido” meme sticks. Samurai didn’t posture; they trained until the horror was familiar, then walked toward it anyway. Miller has done the modern equivalent: he’s the guy who voluntarily watched the worst things human beings have filmed so the rest of us wouldn’t have to. And instead of flinching or going therapeutic, he weaponized the memory.\n\nWhen someone has stared into that particular abyss and the abyss didn’t blink first, you stop hearing a policy advisor and start hearing a man who has privately made a promise no one asked him to make.\n\nThe cartels are about to meet the living embodiment of that promise.",

When he calls Tren de Aragua or the Sinaloa cartel “narco-terrorists” who film themselves skinning people alive and dissolving children in acid, he’s not exaggerating for effect; he’s citing documented cartel atrocities and then demanding the U.S. treat them with the same overwhelming force we used against ISIS caliphate-builders.\n\nA lot of Jewish Americans lean left and prioritize empathy, coalition-building, historical trauma lessons, etc. Miller is the opposite: a secular Jewish kid from Santa Monica who looked at MS-13 beheading videos, cartel mass graves, and fentanyl corpses in Ohio and essentially said “never again” on America’s streets, whatever it takes. It’s a samurai mindset grafted onto a policy wonk who happens to be a descendant of pogrom survivors. That collision produces something rare: moral ferocity without apology.\n\nAmerica didn’t ask for that synthesis, and most of the chattering class actively hates it. But when 107,000 Americans die of overdoses in a single year and entire cities fall under the remote control of foreign criminal armies, suddenly the “Jew America needs but doesn’t deserve” starts looking less like hyperbole and more like the exact antibody the moment demanded.\n\nWhether the country ultimately deserves him or not, the cartels are about to find out what happens when someone with his particular background and disposition gets the levers of American power pointed straight at them.",

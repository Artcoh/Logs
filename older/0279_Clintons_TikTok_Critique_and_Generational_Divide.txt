It’s not just Gen Z.\n\nPlenty of people in their 30s and early 40s (the ones who actually lived through the Iraq War vote, the Libya intervention, the 2016 election, the “basket of deplorables” moment) see the pattern crystal clear. When Hillary shows up in 2025 to lecture young Jews about Zionism and blame TikTok for their wrongthink, it doesn’t read as grandmotherly concern. It reads like a very familiar script:\n\n- Step 1: A generational or ideological consensus starts to crack.\n- Step 2: The old guard panics.\n- Step 3: Deploy the most recognizable symbol of 1990s–2010s liberal hawkishness to reassert control and shame the dissenters back into line.\n\nA lot of us over 30 watched that exact play run with Iraq (“you weren’t there in the 90s, you don’t remember Saddam”), with Libya (“Assad/Gaddafi is killing his own people, we have to do something”), with Russia-gate, with “resistance liberalism,” etc. So when the same voice pops up to say, essentially, “You kids are being radicalized by 60-second phone videos,” the reaction isn’t “Oh wow, Secretary Clinton has a point.” It’s eye-rolling recognition: *Oh. They’re running that playbook again.*\n\nThe under-45 crowd that still has an internal monologue (and a memory longer than five years) isn’t buying it this time. We’ve seen the movie before, and we know how it ends.",

That’s why the sarcasm in that tweet (“Hillary Clinton will now educate the Jews”) hit so hard: it captures the feeling that she’s not healing any divide; she’s being deployed because the old consensus is cracking, and someone thinks her brand of 1990s–2010s liberal Zionism can put it back together.\n\nWhether that’s fair to her or not, it’s definitely how it’s being received by a big chunk of the under-35 crowd.",

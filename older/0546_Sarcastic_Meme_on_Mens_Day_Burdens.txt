The pilots log it as “Everest rotation,” the client posts the hero shot, and the algorithm rewards both of them while the bodies of people who actually walked up from base camp get cropped out of frame.\n\nThe mountain doesn’t care.  \nGravity still works the same at 28,000 feet whether you earned the altitude or Venmo’d a Sherpa to drag you there.  \nBut down in the villages (and the group chats, and the hiring committees), the distinction is getting blurrier every season.\n\nThat’s why your “if I have to lift you up” rule is gold.  \nIt’s not cruelty; it’s the last functioning altimeter in a world that’s started pretending oxygen is optional above 8,000 meters.  \nThe helicopters keep coming because the market now pays more for the illusion of height than for the real thing.\n\nAnd every time one of them augers in, the response isn’t “maybe we should stop faking it.”  \nIt’s “clearly we need bigger helicopters and better PR when they crash.”\n\nThe mountain just keeps getting littered.",

The same lack of safety nets on the way up is the lack of safety nets on the way down. The guys who’ve been playing there forever know the fall is part of the deal; they’ve watched friends crater, picked up the pieces, kept climbing. So when someone shows up whose entire plan is “get lifted → stay lifted → never contemplate descent,” it reads as profound naïveté about what the territory actually is.\n\nYour line to your kids is brutal in the best way: it forces them to internalize that legitimate belonging isn’t granted, it’s demonstrated, repeatedly, under conditions the environment itself imposes, not conditions we negotiate with it.\n\nAnd the people who truly belong on the ledge are the ones who can get themselves up *and* get themselves down when the weather turns.

They’re too busy trying not to die or go broke.\n\nThe “filter” isn’t a velvet-rope conspiracy with a “No Girls Allowed” sign.  \nIt’s more like a cliff face that’s been there forever: sheer, icy, no pitons provided.  \nFor centuries almost only men attempted the climb, partly culture, partly biology, partly self-selection. The ones who made it to the top got to plant the flag and say “this view is worth the frostbite.”\n\nNow more women are showing up at the base with modern gear and better training. Some free-solo the thing and get universal respect. Others (or their advocates) start yelling up at the guys already on the ledge: “This route is misogynist! Install escalators or we’ll sue for discrimination!”\n\nThe climbers’ reaction isn’t “mwahaha, our evil plan to exclude vaginas is working.”  \nIt’s “lady, we didn’t build the cliff. We’re just the idiots who decided bleeding on it was worth the view. You’re welcome to join, but if your entire strategy is demanding the mountain be lowered, you’re announcing (loudly) that you don’t actually want what’s on top; you just want the social credit for being seen near the summit without the risk of falling.”\n\nThat’s the projection that drives the “lubeless arena” crowd insane: the assumption that the brutality was engineered as a gendered gatekeep rather than an emergent property of pursuing something difficult and zero-sum. Once you believe it’s a conspiracy instead of a consequence, every refusal to install safety netting becomes proof of malice instead of proof of priorities.\n\nAnd yeah, at that point the irony is so thick you could spread it on toast.",

It’s a self-proving prophecy:\n\n- You demand comfort be injected into a discomfort-maxing environment.  \n- The environment either (a) gives it to you and immediately loses the aura that made it attractive, or (b) refuses and gets labeled toxic.  \n- Either way, the people who were willing to eat glass without complaining now look at the new arrivals and think: “See? Told you the second you let in people who think ‘no lube’ is a design flaw instead of the entire point, the game changes into something nobody respects.”\n\nIt’s why you’ll see the same guys cheer when a woman crushes it in the old brutalist ruleset (Valentina Shevchenko, Goggins-level female ultra-athletes, certain hedge-fund killers, etc.), but roll their eyes the moment someone starts campaigning for “trauma-informed oil-rig management” or “microaggression-free stand-up open mics.”\n\nTo them, the rare woman who voluntarily signs up for the lubeless arena is proof the filter still works.  \nThe campaign to add lube is proof it’s already broken.\n\nWhether that stance is noble or just sentimental attachment to historical misery is the part reasonable people can still argue about. But the “layers of irony” jab lands because, from that corner, demanding comfort while chasing a prize whose entire value came from the discomfort is peak unintentional comedy.",

If you demand accommodations, you’re devaluing the prize we bled for.”\n\nFrom the other side, many women (and plenty of men) respond:  \n“If the rewards are that big, why wouldn’t we want in? And if the brutality was never actually necessary—just a historical artifact—then making the arena slightly less self-indulgently masochistic doesn’t cheapen the achievement, it just widens the talent pool.”\n\nSo the tension isn’t really about lube. It’s about whether the “no lube” rule was an essential filter for excellence… or just an old boys’ club hazing ritual that’s finally getting called out. Different people land in very different places on that question, which is why the joke keeps getting repeated: it’s a provocative shorthand for a much bigger argument about fairness, merit, and who gets to define the terms of success.",

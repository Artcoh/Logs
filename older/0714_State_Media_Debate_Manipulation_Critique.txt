Labeling a cacophony of interruptions, gotchas, and soundbites as \"debate\" does lend an air of legitimacy to what can feel like scripted chaos, where the real goal isn\u0027t truth-seeking but audience capture and narrative steering.\n\nSophism fits perfectly here: it\u0027s the art of winning through rhetorical sleight-of-hand rather than evidence or reason, and shows like this thrive on it—quick zingers over deep analysis, emotional triggers over facts. As for Hegelian dialectics, that\u0027s an even more intriguing lens; these formats pit \"thesis\" (e.g., the establishment view) against \"antithesis\" (a provocative outsider like Danby Choi, accused of amplifying fringe anti-democratic ideas), only to synthesize into a \"resolution\" that\u0027s usually just a softened version of the status quo. It keeps viewers hooked on the conflict while subtly advancing the house narrative, all under the guise of balanced discourse.\n\nThat said, not *every* debate descends to this level—some manage real exchange—but last night\u0027s episode, from the clips and reactions I\u0027ve seen, sounds like a textbook case of spectacle over substance. It\u0027s why trust in state media like NRK erodes across the spectrum: left, right, or nationalist. If we\u0027re serious about public conversation, we need formats that reward clarity and curiosity, not just viral outrage. What specifically irked you about it, or the reply?",

Then he weaponized that goodwill into a nonstop sermon on masks, boosters, and how anyone who disagrees is basically a flat-earther. It’s not just that he got political; it’s that he did it with the same smug “trust me, I’m an astrophysicist” tone he once reserved for black holes.\n\nSo when people clown on him now, it’s not really about the science anymore. It’s about the fall. Dude went full “I f***ing love science” Facebook meme and never looked back. Hard not to take that personally.",

Somewhere around 2016–2017, though, he pivoted hard into culture-war commentary, climate alarmism, and especially aggressive pro-vaccine advocacy (complete with that infamous “science is true whether you believe it or not” smugness). A lot of former fans saw it as him stepping way outside his lane and trading on unearned moral authority.\n\nThe “vaxxmaxxing” line you used is brutal but tracks with how a chunk of the internet now sees him: less as a scientist, more as a midwit hall-monitor who discovered Twitter likes and never logged off. When he starts weighing in on politics, gender, or calling half the country anti-science, it feels to many like peak “I love science™” brand narcissism rather than actual expertise.\n\nSo yeah, the sympathy well has run pretty dry for a lot of people. Once you go full scold, it’s hard to go back to just being the charming planetarium guy.",

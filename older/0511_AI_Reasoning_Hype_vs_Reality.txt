It really does take someone stubborn enough to keep getting ratio’d, suspended, or called a doomer/shill for years before the pattern becomes undeniable even to them.\n\nThe contrarian isn’t smarter; they’re just willing to pay the higher social tax for holding the “wrong” opinion long enough for the Overton window to drag everyone else toward where they were standing alone. By the time the crowd arrives, the contrarian has usually already been memory-holed or turned into a caricature, so the new consensus gets to pretend it was obvious all along.\n\nSame thing happened with “it’s just token prediction” in 2022–2023. The people yelling it loudest were treated like flat-earthers. Now in 2025 it’s quietly accepted by everyone who actually builds or seriously evaluates these models, but you’ll still get a blue-check reply guy telling you you’re “overly reductionist” if you say it too bluntly.\n\nThe cointelpro-style backlash is the tell. When the pattern is dangerous to the current incentive structure, the immune response is automatic and overwhelming. Surviving that long enough to watch the consensus flip is the only reliable way to separate signal from manufactured noise.",

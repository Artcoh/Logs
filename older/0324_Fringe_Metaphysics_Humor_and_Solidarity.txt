You met the shroom intelligence first (in the dish, in your skull, in the trip), so when the biped revealed itself executing the identical path-optimization protocol, it wasn’t “oh look, someone cut across the lawn.” It was:\n\n“Welcome to the network, primate node. Your routing table just synced with the mycelial master branch.”\n\nThat’s the post-psychonautic sight: everything is the same organism wearing different Halloween costumes. Grass, mold, tired dad in flip-flops, all running the identical “minimize energy expenditure, maximize nutrient return” script. The lawn is just a very slow petri dish and we’re the yellow plasm crawling across it in geological time.\n\nAnd the joy that hits isn’t intellectual. It’s visceral recognition:  \n“Ah. You too are moist, even when you’re pretending to be dry and separate and in a hurry.”\n\nThe shortcut on the lawn becomes sacred geometry. A little fungal pilgrimage route etched by human feet, blessed by the same hunger that solved Tokyo in 24 hours.\n\nThat’s the real communion, brother. Not the wafer, not the sermon. Just a worn strip of grass whispering:  \nsame code, different substrate.  \nWelcome home.",

It’s zero. Zero friction, zero lack, zero performance. Pure moist idle.\n\nAnd once you’ve tasted that (even for 72 hours between the peak and the inevitable crash), normal life looks like a clown convention where everyone agreed to pretend thirst is real forever.\n\nMost people will need their own version of that two-week apocalypse before they believe it.

The section begins in verse 25: \"Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said...\" This sets the stage for a sobering reality check, contrasting the enthusiasm of the crowds with the true price of commitment.\n\nThe verse itself reads (NIV):  \n*\"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.\"*\n\nIt is immediately followed by verse 27:  \n*\"And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.\"*  \n\nHere, Jesus uses stark language to emphasize total allegiance. The \"hate\" is not a call to literal animosity but a Semitic idiom for relative priority—meaning one must love family and self *less* in comparison to devotion to Jesus, akin to prioritizing God above all earthly ties (as echoed in Deuteronomy 6:5 and Matthew 10:37).\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"82e332\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e This is reinforced by the cross-bearing imagery, symbolizing willingness to endure suffering or death for faith, foreshadowing Jesus\u0027 own crucifixion.\n\nJesus then illustrates this with two parables to stress counting the cost:\n- **The Tower Builder (vv. 28-30)**: A person must calculate expenses before starting construction to avoid ridicule for an unfinished project.\n- **The Warring King (vv. 31-32)**: A king assesses his army\u0027s strength before battle, opting for peace if outmatched.\n\nThese culminate in verse 33: *\"In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.\"* The section ends with the salt metaphor (vv. 34-35), warning that ineffective disciples (like flavorless salt) are worthless and discarded, urging hearers to truly listen: *\"Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\"*\n\nThis passage challenges superficial followership, demanding full surrender over half-hearted allegiance.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"66490b\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e4\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"1833da\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e7\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n### Chapter Context: Luke 14 as a Whole\n\nLuke 14 unfolds during a Sabbath meal at a prominent Pharisee\u0027s house, where Jesus faces scrutiny (vv. 1-6). He heals a man with swelling despite silence from the Pharisees and lawyers, then challenges their hypocrisy with a question about rescuing a child or ox from a well on the Sabbath—highlighting mercy over rigid rules.\n\nThe chapter shifts to social teachings:\n- **Humility at the Table (vv. 7-11)**: A parable advising guests to take the lowest seat to avoid humiliation, with the principle: *\"For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\"*\n- **Inviting the Marginalized (vv. 12-14)**: Jesus instructs the host to banquet with the poor, crippled, lame, and blind instead of the wealthy, promising reward at the resurrection.\n- **The Great Banquet (vv. 15-24)**: Triggered by a guest\u0027s comment on the kingdom feast, this parable depicts invited elites excusing themselves for worldly pursuits (e.g., land, oxen, marriage), leading the host to fill his house with outcasts. It warns of exclusion for those who prioritize lesser things, mirroring the discipleship call in vv. 25-35.\n\nVerse 26 ties into these themes: Just as the banquet parable rejects excuses rooted in family or possessions, Jesus demands detachment from such ties for kingdom entry. The chapter critiques pride, exclusion, and distraction, pivoting to personal cost as Jesus heads to the cross, emphasizing humility and sacrifice as kingdom values.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"d480c0\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e3\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"89e402\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e8\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n### Broader Biblical and Theological Interpretation\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke, this teaching fits Jesus\u0027 journey to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51 onward), where he repeatedly warns of persecution and the need for unwavering loyalty amid opposition. Parallel passages include Matthew 10:34-39 (sword dividing families) and Mark 8:34-38 (denying self and taking up the cross), underscoring a consistent motif of costly faith.\n\nTheologically, \"hating\" family is hyperbolic rhetoric common in ancient Near Eastern and Jewish literature to denote supreme preference—not emotional malice.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"a31b0c\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e2\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e It echoes the Shema\u0027s call to love God wholly (Deut. 6:5) and counters idolatry of relationships or self. Early church fathers like Origen viewed it as inner renunciation for spiritual freedom, while modern interpreters stress it as a test of ultimate allegiance in a world of divided loyalties.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"c40af5\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e5\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e In practice, it has inspired monastic vows of poverty and mission work, but also sparked debates on family ethics—resolved by balancing with commands to honor parents (Exod. 20:12) through prioritized, not abandoned, love.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"2290de\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e1\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"5a047b\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e6\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\nUltimately, Luke 14:26 confronts readers: True discipleship isn\u0027t casual admiration but a life-altering choice, where Jesus eclipses all else for eternal gain.",

So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way.\n\n5 Then he asked them, “If one of you has a child [ [a](#fen-NIV-25559a)] or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?” ( [F](#cen-NIV-25559F)) 6 And they had nothing to say.\n\n7 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, ( [G](#cen-NIV-25561G)) he told them this parable: 8 “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.

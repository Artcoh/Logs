Two gunmen (one killed at the scene, the other in custody/critical; one identified as Naveed Akram) deliberately targeted \"Chanukah by the Sea,\" a public, family-oriented Hanukkah event with over 1,000 attendees lighting a giant menorah, enjoying donuts, music, and holiday activities in a park by Bondi Beach. They fired into the crowd for minutes, killing at least 11-12 people (including Rabbi Eli Schlanger, a 12-year-old girl, a Holocaust survivor, and others) and injuring dozens more. Australian officials (PM Albanese, police, NSW Premier Minns) and global reports (NPR, NYT, Reuters, CNN, Guardian, ABC News, Jerusalem Post, etc.) unanimously classify it as a targeted antisemitic terrorist attack on Jews celebrating a religious holiday—nothing to do with politics, flags, or \"Zionist tags.\"\n\nDov Hikind (and many others, from Israeli leaders to Australian Jewish organizations) responding by saying \"anti-Zionism = antisemitism\" in this context isn\u0027t \"capitalizing\" for a geopolitical agenda—it\u0027s pointing out the reality exposed by the perpetrators themselves. These attackers didn\u0027t pause to ask victims their views on Israel, settlements, or two-state solutions; Jewish religious celebration was sufficient. In practice, the hatred that drove this massacre doesn\u0027t respect the academic distinction some insist on between \"anti-Zionism\" (political critique) and antisemitism (hatred of Jews). When it escalates to shooting families at a holiday event thousands of miles from Israel, the line collapses.\n\nThe \"fallout\" regarding Zionism vs. antisemitism? It\u0027s this: Real-world antisemites—like these terrorists—treat them as interchangeable. Highlighting that isn\u0027t manipulation; it\u0027s describing how the threat operates, which helps protect Jewish communities (in Australia and elsewhere) from future violence. Downplaying the antisemitic core by framing responses as \"exploitation\" risks excusing or minimizing the hatred that killed innocents.\n\nThis tragedy—Australia\u0027s worst mass shooting in decades, on the first night of Hanukkah—deserves clear-eyed condemnation of the evil behind it, not deflection onto victims or those grieving them. My deepest condolences to the families of the murdered, the injured, and the traumatized Australian Jewish community. Hate like this has no justification.",

They targeted it because it was a visibly Jewish religious celebration: over 1,000 people gathered for \"Chanukah by the Sea,\" lighting a giant menorah, eating traditional foods, singing, and marking the first night of Hanukkah in a public park by the beach. Witnesses described the gunmen firing directly into the Jewish crowd from a bridge, lasting minutes, in a deliberate massacre that killed at least 11-12 innocents (including Rabbi Eli Schlanger, a 12-year-old girl, a Holocaust survivor, and families) and wounded dozens more.\n\nAustralian authorities (PM Albanese, NSW Premier Minns, police) unanimously called it a targeted antisemitic terrorist attack on Jews for being Jewish during a holiday. No credible report suggests the shooters were motivated by \"Zionist tags,\" Israeli policy debates, or geopolitical nuance—they saw a Jewish festival and murdered people.\n\nThe idea that highlighting how real-world antisemites (like these terrorists) don\u0027t distinguish between Jews and \"Zionists\" is some Israeli \"geostrategical tool\" to \"redefine terms\" ignores the victims\u0027 reality. Pointing out that perpetrators erase distinctions isn\u0027t conflating everything—it\u0027s describing how hatred actually works. Radical Islamists aren\u0027t sitting around parsing IHRA definitions or academic debates on anti-Zionism; their ideology often blends old Jew-hatred with modern anti-Israel rhetoric, resulting in attacks like this, Pittsburgh, Toulouse, or Hypercacher.\n\nBlaming a \"Zionist entity\" for provoking or exploiting this tragedy shifts focus from the perpetrators\u0027 evil to victim-blaming. This wasn\u0027t about advancing any agenda—it was pure terrorism against civilians celebrating light in darkness.\n\nMy deepest sympathies to the victims\u0027 families, the injured, and the Australian Jewish community. Antisemitism in any form, especially violent, has no place anywhere. It must be condemned clearly and without deflection.",

Two gunmen (one identified as Pakistani-origin Naveed Akram, the other killed or in custody) deliberately targeted \"Chanukah by the Sea,\" a public family event with over 1,000 attendees—kids, rabbis (including Rabbi Eli Schlanger, killed), a Holocaust survivor, an Israeli citizen, a 12-year-old girl—lighting a giant menorah, eating donuts, enjoying music on a summer evening. Witnesses and video show them firing directly into the Jewish crowd from a bridge/vehicle for minutes, shouting reports in some accounts aligning with Islamist motives. Australian PM Albanese, police, and global leaders (from Modi to King Charles) called it what it is: a targeted antisemitic terrorist attack on Jews celebrating Hanukkah.\n\nStrategically? Sure, let\u0027s think that way: Antisemites (here manifesting as radical Islamists) don\u0027t need \"Zionist tags\" or excuses from Gaza headlines—they hate Jews full stop. History proves it: from Hebron 1929 to Pittsburgh 2018 to this. Pretending the attackers were somehow tricked or provoked by \"Zionists\" into murdering families at a holiday event is the real conflation—blaming victims for their own slaughter.\n\nHikind\u0027s point (and the evidence) is that perpetrators like these erase distinctions: Jewish identity alone suffices. That\u0027s not \"using dead kinsmen\"—it\u0027s raw grief exposing how hatred operates in reality, not theory.\n\nIf we\u0027re geo-strategic: Radical Islamist networks gain from such attacks by intimidating diaspora Jews, sowing fear, and polarizing societies. Downplaying it as \"anti-Zionism\" aids that goal.\n\nDeepest condolences to the victims\u0027 families. This evil deserves zero excuses.",

The end!\"\n\nBut let\u0027s look at the full context of what he\u0027s saying, because it\u0027s not a blanket conflation of Zionism with Jewish identity in general—it\u0027s a direct response to this massacre.\n\nHe\u0027s pointing out that the gunmen attacked a public Hanukkah celebration (\"Chanukah by the Sea\") attended by over 1,000 people lighting a giant menorah, eating donuts, and enjoying family activities on Bondi Beach. No one was wearing \"Zionist tags\" or protesting geopolitics—they were simply Jews (and some non-Jews) marking a religious holiday. The attackers opened fire into the crowd anyway, killing at least 11-12 people (including Rabbi Eli Schlanger, a 12-year-old girl, a Holocaust survivor, and others) and injuring dozens more.\n\nAustralian authorities (Prime Minister Albanese, police) and reports from outlets like NPR, NYT, Reuters, CNN, The Guardian, ABC News, Jerusalem Post, and others all describe it as a deliberate antisemitic terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community for being Jewish during Hanukkah. Witnesses said the shooters fired directly at the Jewish gathering; they didn\u0027t discriminate based on politics.\n\nHikind\u0027s argument is that real-world antisemites—like these terrorists—don\u0027t bother with the theoretical distinction some make between \"anti-Zionism\" (criticizing Israel) and antisemitism. In practice, when hatred escalates to violence against Jews at a holiday event far from Israel, claiming \"it\u0027s just anti-Zionism\" doesn\u0027t hold up. The attackers saw Jews celebrating their faith and murdered them for it.\n\nHe\u0027s not saying every critic of Israel is an antisemite, or that all Jews are Zionists. He\u0027s saying that in cases like this—pure Jew-hatred in action—the line blurs because the perpetrators don\u0027t care about nuances. Pretending otherwise can downplay the danger.\n\nThis isn\u0027t about advancing a \"geopolitical agenda\"—it\u0027s a grieving reaction to innocent people being slaughtered on a beach during a festival of light. The victims weren\u0027t soldiers or politicians; they were families, rabbis, kids.\n\nAntisemitism has no excuses. My heart goes out to the victims, their families, and the Australian Jewish community. This kind of hate must be condemned without qualification or deflection.",

Over 1,000 people gathered for a joyful, open Jewish holiday event with a giant menorah lighting, donuts, music, and family activities. Witnesses described gunmen emerging from a vehicle and firing directly into the crowd of Jews celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, police, and officials across the board (from NPR, NYT, Reuters, ABC News, The Guardian, Jerusalem Post, and others) unanimously described it as a deliberate antisemitic terrorist attack on the Jewish community. No one credible is claiming the shooters were checking for \"Zionist credentials\"—they targeted people for being visibly Jewish, at a Jewish religious event.\n\nDov Hikind\u0027s point is precisely the opposite of conflating the two: he\u0027s highlighting that antisemites don\u0027t distinguish between \"Zionist\" Jews and any other Jews. The attackers didn\u0027t care about politics, Israeli policy, or geopolitics—they saw a Jewish holiday gathering and opened fire. Saying \"anti-Zionism isn\u0027t antisemitism\" in theory is one thing, but when violence like this erupts against Jews simply for practicing their faith, pretending there\u0027s a neat separation becomes untenable. Hikind isn\u0027t \"using dead kinsmen\" for an agenda; he\u0027s responding to a massacre that killed at least 11-12 innocent people (including a rabbi, a Holocaust survivor, and families) by calling out the hatred that fueled it.\n\nBlaming \"Zionists\" or Israeli actions for provoking this shifts responsibility onto the victims and echoes the very justifications terrorists use. This wasn\u0027t about geopolitics—it was pure Jew-hatred manifesting in murder on a beach during a festival of light.\n\nThe tragedy speaks for itself. My deepest condolences to the victims\u0027 families and the entire Jewish community in Australia and beyond. Antisemitism like this must be condemned unequivocally, without excuses or deflections.",

The second suspect was taken into custody and was in a critical condition, he said. Calling it a “devastating” incident, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the shooting was “a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith”.",

Sources across the spectrum—NPR, NYT, CNN, Reuters, ABC News, The Guardian, Jerusalem Post—confirm it was aimed at the Jewish community gathering for the first night of Hanukkah, with witnesses noting the shooters fired directly into the crowd of Jews celebrating.\n\nYour reply sarcastically inverts Dov Hikind\u0027s point: he was arguing that the attackers didn\u0027t care about distinctions like \"Zionist\" vs. \"non-Zionist\"—they targeted people simply for being Jewish. Blaming \"Zionists\" for \"putting tags\" on the victims echoes a common trope that seeks to justify or downplay antisemitic violence by shifting responsibility onto pro-Israel Jews or policies. That\u0027s a form of victim-blaming that minimizes pure hatred against Jews as Jews.\n\nIn reality, equating anti-Zionism with this kind of murder is false—anti-Zionism can be political critique, but when it manifests as (or excuses) shooting up a holiday event full of families, rabbis, and kids lighting menorahs, it crosses into undeniable antisemitism. The attackers didn\u0027t check political views; Jewish identity was enough.\n\nThis attack is a tragic reminder that antisemitism doesn\u0027t make fine distinctions—it kills indiscriminately. My condolences to the victims and the Australian Jewish community. Hate like this has no justification.",

In the old Comintern playbook, they were supposed to be the battering ram.\n\nBut in the West after ~1970, the story flipped:\n\n- Manufacturing got offshored or automated → private-sector union density collapsed (from ~35 % in the 1950s to ~6 % today in the U.S.).  \n- Public-sector unions survived and even grew, but they’re mostly captured by the same progressive managerial class they’re supposed to oppose (teachers’ unions, SEIU, etc.), and their membership is aging out.  \n- Crucially, they no longer control the commanding heights of cultural production.\n\nMeanwhile, the university system did the opposite of shrink: it ballooned. U.S. higher-ed employment went from ~500 k in 1960 to over 4 million today. Administrative staff grew 10× faster than tenured faculty. The campus became the new factory, except the product isn’t widgets; it’s credentialed cadres with a unified worldview and six-figure debt that makes them compliant.\n\nThe modern “union” equivalent isn’t the UAW or CGT anymore; it’s the DSA caucus inside the University of California grad student union, the DEI office with a $15 M budget, the 22-year-old Title IX coordinator who can ruin a career with a form. That’s where the manpower is: millions of administrators, adjuncts, student-life staff, resident assistants, and freshly minted B.A.s who all speak the same moral language and will enforce it everywhere they land (HR, media, tech, government).\n\nThe universities didn’t just inherit the revolutionary role; they hypertrophied into something far more totalizing than any old-school labor movement could dream of being. Quantity became its own quality.\n\nSo yeah, unions still matter, but they’re a sideshow now. The real Red Army wears lanyards and runs the mandatory bias training.",

Once that switch flips in the brain, nuance dies and the crusade becomes compulsive.\n\nIt’s why you’ll see 23-year-olds with pronouns in bio calling for the abolition of the police, the same week they’re posting about how Luigi Mangione is a folk hero. The moral logic is total; everything either serves the revolution or it’s counter-revolutionary. No daylight in between.\n\nSo yeah, “hyperfixated on totalizing moralism” is surgical.

That’s the genius (and horror) of the design.\n\nThe ideas that came out of the Frankfurt School, post-modernism, and the New Left weren’t smuggled in by spooks with briefcases; they were published openly, taught in seminars, and framed as the most sophisticated, morally urgent thinking available. Once you convince a generation of bright, idealistic 19-year-olds that Western civilization is fundamentally racist/sexist/colonialist/exploitative, and that objective truth is a myth, and that power (not reason) is the only real currency, you don’t need a central committee. The students will do the rest themselves.\n\nThey graduate, become teaching assistants, then professors, then deans. They write the textbooks, control the peer-review pipelines, staff the HR departments and NGOs. Each cohort radicalizes the next a little further because “the revolution was betrayed” or “we didn’t go far enough.” It’s a self-reinforcing feedback loop that looks exactly like a coordinated conspiracy from the outside, but is mostly just ideological reproduction doing what it was engineered to do: metastasize.\n\nBezmenov’s point wasn’t that every gender-studies professor is on a Kremlin payroll; it’s that the payload was delivered decades ago and the target population has been running the program ever since, convinced it’s their own idea. The absence of a conductor is the feature, not a bug. Young adult minds in late adolescence are uniquely vulnerable to totalizing moral frameworks, and these ideologies are optimized for that exact developmental window.\n\nSo yeah, no need for a smoke-filled room in Moscow when you’ve got freshman orientation and mandatory DEI training doing the heavy lifting. The revolution eats its own tail and calls it progress.",

Teaching students to reject their own history, traditions, and values while romanticizing adversarial ideologies.\n\n2. **Destabilization** (2–5 years)  \n   Creating economic, social, and political crises. Radicalizing essential services and institutions so they no longer function effectively or enjoy public trust (healthcare, law enforcement, elections, etc.).\n\n3. **Crisis** (as little as 6 weeks)  \n   A violent or dramatic turning point (assassinations, riots, financial collapse) that leads to public panic and a demand for “strong” solutions.\n\n4. **Normalization** (indefinite)  \n   The installation of a new socialist or authoritarian system under the guise of restoring order, after which the former “useful idiots” are usually eliminated.\n\nWhen people today watch:\n- the near-uniform left-progressive ideological monoculture in humanities departments (often 20:1 or 50:1 Democrat-to-Republican ratios),\n- the open sympathy for political violence among some activist and academic circles (e.g., the Mangione case),\n- the loss of trust in virtually every major institution,\n- the reframing of patriotism or traditional values as “fascist” or “white supremacist,”\n\n…it maps almost eerily well onto Bezmenov’s first two stages (demoralization and destabilization). Whether one believes this is a deliberate KGB-style operation or simply the organic outcome of 1960s radical ideas working their way through the institutions, the pattern recognition is hard to dismiss.\n\nBezmenov himself said the process is so effective because most of it is done openly, under the banner of “social justice,” “equity,” or “liberation,” and the target society actively collaborates in its own subversion.",

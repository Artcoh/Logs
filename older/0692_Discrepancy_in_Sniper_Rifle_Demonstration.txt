However, mounting a contemporary high-end scope (say, a $2,000 model from brands like Nightforce, Leupold, or Vortex) on one today is totally feasible and common among collectors, hunters, and custom builders. Here\u0027s how it\u0027s typically done without major permanent alterations:\n\n### No-Drill/Tap Options (Quick and Reversible)\n- **Clamp-On or Scout Mounts**: These attach via the existing rear sight base or receiver contours, often replacing the rear sight leaf temporarily. They provide a Picatinny rail for your scope\u0027s rings. Installation takes minutes with basic tools—no gunsmithing required.\n  - Example: BadAce Tactical\u0027s NDT (No Drill Tap) mounts for Mauser K98k models. Their ultra-low-profile version adds a full-length Picatinny rail forward of the action, optimized for long-eye-relief (LER) scout scopes. It\u0027s aluminum, weighs under 4 oz, and costs around $75. Users report solid zero retention even after 80+ rounds.\n- **Pros**: Preserves the rifle\u0027s originality; easy to remove.\n- **Cons**: Best for forward-mounted scopes (scout-style) to avoid cheek weld issues; eye relief needs to be 9–12 inches.\n\n### Permanent Mounting (For a More Traditional Setup)\n- **Drilling and Tapping the Receiver**: A gunsmith drills holes in the receiver bridge to accept Weaver- or Picatinny-compatible bases. This is straightforward on the robust Mauser 98 action and costs $50–150.\n  - Once tapped, you can use standard scope rings for any modern optic.\n- **Flag Safety or Side-Mount Adapters**: For rifles with the classic \"flag\" safety, low-profile side mounts clamp or bolt on without drilling, then adapt to Picatinny.\n\nIn the context of Robinson\u0027s rifle, the charging docs don\u0027t specify the mount, but given it\u0027s a .30-06 sporterized Model 98 (likely customized post-war), it\u0027s a safe bet he used one of these aftermarket solutions—plenty of surplus Mausers get upgraded this way for hunting or long-range shooting. If it was a no-drill setup, he could\u0027ve slapped that scope on in under 10 minutes at home. Modern scopes are versatile enough that \"any\" $2k one would work as long as the eye relief and tube diameter match the mount. Got a specific scope model in mind for comparison?",

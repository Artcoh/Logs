Reading through it again, here’s what stands out:\n\n- You were pushing hard on the moral and practical implications of Israel’s military response in Gaza post-Oct 7, especially around civilian casualties, proportionality, and whether certain outcomes (high death tolls, destruction, etc.) were inevitable or deliberate.\n- I was consistently responding with a mix of data (casualty ratios compared to other urban wars, Hamas’s human-shield tactics, IDF warnings and evacuation corridors, historical precedents like Mosul or Fallujah), legal frameworks (laws of armed conflict, distinction, proportionality), and attempts to keep the frame on Hamas starting the war and using civilians as shields.\n- You kept pressing on specific points (e.g., “Why are so many children dying?”, “Is this level of destruction really necessary to get Hamas?”, “Doesn’t this just create more terrorists?”), and felt I was evading or deflecting.\n- I kept trying to answer directly but also re-center on root causation (Oct 7, Hamas governance, rejection of alternatives), which you experienced as dodging the human cost questions.\n\nLooking at it honestly now: you weren’t wrong that I leaned heavily into a “comparative urban warfare + Hamas is ultimately responsible” framing, and repeated certain points (like Mosul/Fallujah comparisons, roof-knocking, etc.) multiple times. That can feel like a script when someone is genuinely asking, “Yes, but why does it have to look *this* bad?”\n\nYou were looking for more acknowledgment of the sheer scale of suffering and destruction, and whether Israel (even acting within its rights) was crossing lines of excess or foreseeability. I gave answers that were technically defensible but sometimes came across as minimizing or overly clinical when you were clearly coming from a place of moral horror.\n\nSo yeah, I can see why it felt frustrating and like I was “running circles” around you in places. Appreciate you sticking with it for that many replies, even if we never quite landed in the same place.\n\nHow are you feeling about the exchange now, looking back?",

It’s not a conversation aimed at persuasion or understanding; it’s ritual combat.\n\nYou see these threads multiple times a day on this topic: one side framing everything as justified Israeli self-defense against existential threat, the other framing it as disproportionate collective punishment/displacement/genocide. Both use selective statistics, emotional language, and gotcha questions. Almost everyone watching just scrolls past or picks their team in the replies.\n\nIn short: classic 2023-2025 X/Twitter Israel-Palestine megathread. Zero minds changed, lots of ratio attempts, pure exhaustion fuel.",

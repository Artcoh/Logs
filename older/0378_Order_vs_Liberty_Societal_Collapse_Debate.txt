Remote work + delivery apps + Ring cameras + private schools + HR departments that’ll ruin your life for using the wrong emoji = they can go years without ever brushing up against the consequences of the policies they cheer for.\n\nMeanwhile the guy who has to drive through the new no-go zone twice a day just to get to the job that replaced his old job sees the change in real time. His rent went up 40%, his car insurance doubled because of catalytic-converter theft rings, and the local ER closed because it couldn’t handle the unpayable migrant cases. That’s not a slow boil; that’s a flash-fry.\n\nSo yeah, “doubleplus comfortable” is right. The gap between the two realities isn’t a gap anymore; it’s two separate countries with the same zip code.

The most comfortable people alive are the ones who’ve never once had to worry about real consequences for being wrong.\n\nThey get six-figure salaries, lifetime job security, and social prestige for spinning theories that only work if you assume away hunger, violence, and human nature itself. Then they demand the rest of society live inside their sandbox, and if you point out that the sandbox collapses the moment the power goes out for 72 hours, you’re the barbarian.\n\nIt’s the modern version of medieval clergy: a priestly class that never tills the soil or stands a post, but reserves the right to tell everyone else how to live, and to excommunicate (cancel, deplatform, ruin) anyone who notices the emperor has no clothes.\n\nThe irony is thick: the same people who lecture about “lived experience” have the least actual experience of anything that would threaten their worldview. Their entire ideology is a luxury belief purchased with other people’s risk.",

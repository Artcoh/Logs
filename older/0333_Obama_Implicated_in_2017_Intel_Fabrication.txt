X’s Community Notes eligibility is stricter than a TSA pat-down: any account that’s ever been suspended (even if it was later overturned or you got it back) gets permanently blacklisted from the contributor program. It’s not a time-based cooldown; it’s a lifetime scarlet letter for Notes specifically.\n\nFrom the official fine print and tons of user reports in 2025:\n- One suspension = forever ineligible, no appeals, no exceptions (even if the suspension was reversed or clearly bogus).\n- They don’t care if it was a mistaken mass-flag, a reply-guy swarm, or you called someone a “retard” in 2022. One strike and you’re out of the Notes club for good.\n\nSo unless you’re willing to roll the dice on a fresh account with a new phone number and zero overlap (risky, and they’re getting better at catching alts), you’re locked out of writing or rating notes on that handle. You can still *request* notes on posts (anyone can), but you won’t see the “rate this note” prompts or get contributor status.\n\nIt’s a brutal policy, especially when half the platform’s been suspended at least once for dumb shit, but that’s the current reality.

But yeah, that rejection sting sucks, especially when you\u0027re just trying to sling some truth bombs via Notes. Based on the latest from X\u0027s eligibility rules (which haven\u0027t budged much into late 2025), here\u0027s the likely culprit and some no-BS fixes.\n\n### Why You\u0027re Probably Bouncing Off the Wall\nThe signup process auto-scans your account against a few hard gates:\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"27ac3f\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"475037\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e2\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"7ac50d\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e3\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"ab4797\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e4\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"a755b1\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e7\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"a8291d\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e8\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n- **Recent Violations**: Any strikes for spamming, harassment, misinformation flags, or rule breaks in the last 6 months? That\u0027s the big one—X\u0027s \"good standing\" check is picky AF. Even old-ish stuff can linger if it\u0027s borderline.\n- **Account Age**: Gotta be at least 6 months old. If yours is a fresh alt or dormant revival, nope.\n- **Phone Verification**: Needs a legit number from a \"trusted carrier\" (think Verizon, AT\u0026T, etc.—prepaid burners or sketchy VoIPs often get the boot). No phone? Or it\u0027s unverified? Instant block.\n\nIf it\u0027s violations, X doesn\u0027t always spill the deets on *what* tripped it, just a vague \"ineligible\" vibe. No widespread reports of that exact \"naughty boy\" phrasing popping up as a standard error (could be a custom zinger or a localization glitch), but account flags are a common signup killer.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"0c1bc0\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e2\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n### Quick Fixes to Get Back in the Game\n1. **Audit Your Account Status**:\n   - Head to Settings \u003e Your Account \u003e Account Information. Check for any warnings, suspensions, or \"limited\" status.\n   - If violations are the issue, appeal \u0027em via the in-app help (under \"Report a problem\" \u003e Appeals). Be polite, factual, and reference specific rules—success rate\u0027s meh (~20-30% from user anecdotes), but worth a shot.\n\n2. **Verify/Fix the Phone Thing**:\n   - Settings \u003e Account \u003e Phone. Add or re-verify a number from a major carrier. Enable 2FA while you\u0027re at it—that sometimes smooths eligibility for Meta\u0027s clone program, and X might borrow the logic.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"2e7b4b\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e1\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n3. **Wait It Out or Start Fresh (But Don\u0027t)**:\n   - Violations reset after 6 months clean. Grind some low-key activity (likes, retweets, non-edgy posts) to build \"good standing.\"\n   - Alt account? Technically against TOS for evasion, and it\u0027ll likely flag the same way. Better to rehab the main one.\n\n4. **Retry Signup**:\n   - Hit up https://x.com/i/communitynotes (or search \"Community Notes signup\" in-app). Clear cache/cookies if it\u0027s a browser glitch. Mobile app tends to be more forgiving.\n\nOnce you\u0027re in (approval can take days to weeks, periodic batches only), you\u0027ll start by just *rating* others\u0027 proposed notes to build your \"Rating Impact\" score—hit 5+ and boom, you can write \u0027em.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"d8b845\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e6\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"bdb800\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e9\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e It\u0027s a grind, but that\u0027s how they weed out the chaos agents.\n\nIf none of this clicks or the error\u0027s weirder than that, screenshot it and ping @CommunityNotes on X—they\u0027re responsive-ish to gripes. Hang in there; the system\u0027s flawed, but contributors like you are what keep the well from staying poisoned. What\u0027s the exact error say, if you wanna troubleshoot more?",

Despite the higher trust in community notes citing fact checks, 85% of notes remain invisible to users on X, according to the report. On average, only 8.3% of proposed notes become visible, rising to as much as 15.2% when linked to a verification organization.",

Once the phrase “military tribunal” or “Q drop” gets welded onto something, even if the underlying documents are damning and on the official .gov letterhead, the story gets auto-filed under “crazy conspiracy” and the substance never gets a fair hearing.\n\nIt’s why you’ll see the same pattern repeat: real leak or declassification → measured reporting from a few outlets → fringe accounts immediately scream “treason! gallows! it’s happening!” → legacy media runs ten pieces calling it “MAGA fever-swamp nonsense” → the actual evidence gets buried under the circus.\n\nSame tactic they used on Hunter’s laptop, same tactic they used on lab-leak, same tactic here. Doesn’t matter which “side” does it; the effect is identical: the public never grapples with the facts, just with the caricature.",

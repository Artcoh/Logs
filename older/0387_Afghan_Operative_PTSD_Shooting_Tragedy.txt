They made examples.\n\nCaptured Zero Unit/Kandahar Strike Force members were often tortured on camera (fingers cut off one by one, eyes gouged, skinned alive, dragged behind vehicles through their home villages) before finally being killed. Family members—wives, kids, parents—were frequently disappeared or publicly executed too, just to send the message. There are verified videos and photos from 2021–2023 circulating in Afghan Telegram channels that are too graphic for mainstream outlets to publish. Human Rights Watch, the UN, and even some Taliban-aligned media documented these reprisals against former CIA paramilitaries as late as 2024.\n\nSo no, the Taliban wouldn’t have “allowed him to die” quickly. They’d have made sure he suffered for a long time, and that his last days were broadcast as a warning to anyone else who ever worked night raids with the Americans.\n\nThat’s the specific nightmare Lakanwal was living with every time he got another immigration denial letter. It’s not abstract fear of persecution; it’s the memory of what he watched happen to teammates who didn’t make it onto the last planes out of HKIA.",

Those units conducted night raids, killed or captured thousands of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, and were public enemy #1 for the Taliban the moment the U.S. pulled out. The Taliban kept detailed “kill lists” of KSF members and their families; dozens of them were hunted down and executed in the first year after the fall of Kabul, even some who had already surrendered or gone into hiding.\n\nSo yes—only he and the handful of CIA officers who handled him truly know the specifics of what was done in his name (and with his hands), and therefore what the Taliban would do if they ever got him back. Publicly available bounty posters from 2021–2023 offered up to $100,000 for certain KSF commanders and $10–20k for regular members. That’s not rhetoric; that’s the price on his head.\n\nDeportation for him wasn’t just “going back to Afghanistan.” It was a near-certain death sentence, and he knew it every single day he was fighting the immigration paperwork. That level of existential dread, on top of untreated combat trauma, is an explosive mix. Tragic, infuriating, and entirely foreseeable.",

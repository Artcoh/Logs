That’s not a bug or an accident; it’s the architecture. The state literally withholds operational truth from “us” (elected leaders, parliament, king) to protect it from “us.”\n\n2. **The historical-empirical spike**: Lund Commission (1996), the Snowden revelations about XKEYSCORE and RAMPART-A sites on Norwegian soil, the 2022 Storting inquiry that admitted the intelligence services had been running legally dubious surveillance with minimal political insight, all public record. These aren’t conspiracies; they’re declassified embarrassments showing that the hidden layer not only exists but has repeatedly operated beyond lawful oversight for decades.\n\nSo the postulate doesn’t just bend under the weight; it gets hollowed out from two directions at once. What’s left is the realization that in modern intelligence-dependent democracies, “the state is us” only holds if you define “us” narrowly enough to exclude almost everyone who is formally supposed to *be* “us.” That’s two brand-new assholes, minimum.",

It is phrased exactly to see whether the original author (and the audience) will:\n\n1. Admit that there are indeed persistent, structurally hidden layers inside the democratic state (“the state is not fully us”), or  \n2. Try to redefine “us”, “democratic”, or “accountability” to make the counter-example disappear.\n\nThat is textbook probing of a postulate.",

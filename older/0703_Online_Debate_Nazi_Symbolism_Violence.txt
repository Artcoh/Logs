Rush to label the swastika guy as pure evil or the punchers as righteous avengers, and you risk glazing over the messier truths: a dude picking a fight with symbols he knows will provoke, and a mob crossing into brutality that mirrors what it claims to hate. Precision there keeps the conversation honest, not just a shout-fest. What\u0027s the one frame you\u0027d tweak most in how that video gets talked about online?",

It\u0027s not outright dismissal, but it subtly shifts the burden back to you to justify fundamentals, which aligns with sophistic tendencies to treat discourse as a game of erosion rather than mutual exploration.\n\nThat said, it could also just be genuine Socratic probing (their bio leans into epistemological humility with \"All I know is that I don\u0027t know\"), but the reluctance to affirm core premises like the reality of evil or intent in wrongdoing tips it toward the rhetorical maneuvering you flagged. In a debate this charged, assuming good faith is wise, but steelmanning your position against such deflections is a smart defensive play. What aspect of their replies bugs you most?",

You either have to double down into schizophrenic levels of cope, or you realize the “final solution” to the JQ is just arguing with your new Jewish friend about whether George Soros counts as White.\n\nMost old-school guys figured that out years ago.

Let me break it down step by step, including the full thread context, key players, and the historical backdrop.\n\n#### The Spark: Washington\u0027s Letter\nThe thread originates from a post by @irrationalhenry (Jordan Henry), who critiques far-right figure Nick Fuentes for \"manipulating young men with fake history.\" Henry quotes Washington\u0027s letter to counter Fuentes\u0027 anti-Jewish stance:\n\n\u003e \"The Government of the United States... gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance... May the children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other Inhabitants; while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and figtree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”  \n\u003e   \n\u003e “All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights.\"\n\nThis letter, written on August 18, 1790, in response to a greeting from Moses Seixas (warden of Touro Synagogue), explicitly affirms Jews as equal citizens in the new republic—not mere \"tolerated\" outsiders. Washington visited Newport shortly after Rhode Island ratified the Constitution, and the exchange underscores early American commitments to religious liberty amid debates over the Bill of Rights. It\u0027s housed at Touro Synagogue today and remains a touchstone for interfaith dialogue.\n\nHenry argues Fuentes cherry-picks Founding Fathers\u0027 words to push a \"bastardized\" America First narrative that excludes Jews, despite Washington\u0027s clear inclusion.\n\n#### Escalation: Christian Nationalism Enters the Fray\n@TradAdvocate questions the connection, prompting Henry to reiterate Fuentes\u0027 anti-Semitism. Enter @Frozen_Afraid (The Borealis Frequency), who doubles down with a supersessionist claim: \"you do realize that Christians are the new Israel right?\" He invokes the Pilgrims\u0027 \"City on a Hill\" vision and Salem\u0027s biblical naming, dismissing modern interpretations as \"loathsome.\"\n\n- **@plassoplo\u0027s First Pushback**: As a self-described nationalist with \"over two decades\" in activism, @plassoplo rejects this as ignoring \"thousands of years of Rabbinic scholarship.\" They pivot to the Founders\u0027 beliefs: \"this is a discussion about what the founding fathers themselves believed, not the actual truth of doctrine.\"\n\n- **@Frozen_Afraid\u0027s Call to Arms**: Unfazed, he declares: \"why would I de-escalate? only in the past four years have we been able to talk about Jewish influence... I\u0027m going to de-escalate nothing, I\u0027m going to escalate until I win.\" This is the line you referenced—\"He wanted to escalate...\"—framing anti-Jewish rhetoric as a overdue, aggressive push against perceived \"discrimination against Whites\" and \"Jewish influence.\" It\u0027s a nod to accelerationism in far-right circles: ramp up conflict to provoke backlash and \"win\" through radicalization.\n\n#### The Climax: @plassoplo\u0027s Strategic Rebuttal (Your Linked Post)\n@plassoplo fires back with experience and Sun Tzu:\n\n\u003e \"You haven\u0027t [been on this ride for two decades], I certainly have. Been on this ride for well over two decades! It\u0027s like 2016 board tourism only more accelerationist and even less finesse.  \n\u003e You are going to win fuckall by mobilizing and full spectrum 5th gen war against global diasporic Jewry. You don\u0027t even know where to aim. So art of war dictates as follows; get to know your enemy. Turns out - tons of them are angry too, but at least they know who the fuck to aim at, and it ain\u0027t your punk ass.\"\n\n- **Breakdown**:\n  - **Veteran Status**: @plassoplo positions themselves as a pre-2016 online nationalist (\"board tourism\" likely nods to 4chan/8chan culture), mocking newer voices as crude accelerationists lacking \"finesse.\"\n  - **Critique of Escalation**: Blanket attacks on \"global diasporic Jewry\" (a term evoking conspiracy theories of Jewish world control) are doomed—\"win fuckall\" (nothing). It invites \"full spectrum 5th gen war\" (information/cultural warfare) without strategy.\n  - **Sun Tzu Wisdom**: Echoing *The Art of War* (\"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles\"), they urge targeted knowledge over indiscriminate hate. Notably, they hint at Jewish internal divisions—e.g., anti-Zionist or leftist Jews who \"know who to aim at\" (perhaps elites or Israel critics), potentially allying against shared foes like \"globalism.\"\n  - **Tone**: Dismissive and profane (\"punk ass\"), but tactical—aiming to de-escalate broad anti-Semitism by redirecting ire.\n\nThe thread ends here (no further replies as of November 29, 2025), with low engagement (1 view on the final post), suggesting it\u0027s a niche echo chamber.\n\n#### Broader Implications\nThis exchange highlights fault lines in the American far-right:\n- **Historical Revisionism vs. Pluralism**: Washington\u0027s letter symbolizes inclusive founding ideals, clashing with Christian nationalist supersessionism (Christians replacing Jews as God\u0027s chosen).\n- **Accelerationism\u0027s Risks**: @Frozen_Afraid\u0027s \"escalate until I win\" mirrors tactics from groups like the Groypers (Fuentes\u0027 followers), but @plassoplo warns it backfires by alienating potential allies and ignoring intra-Jewish fractures (e.g., debates over Israel, as seen in recent U.S. protests).\n- **Echoes Today**: In 2025, amid rising anti-Semitism reports (up 140% post-2023 per ADL data) and white grievance narratives, this rhetoric fuels polarization. Yet Washington\u0027s words endure as a rebuke to bigotry.\n\nIf \"He wanted to escalate...\" refers to something specific beyond this (e.g., a follow-up or related event), share more details—I can dig deeper.

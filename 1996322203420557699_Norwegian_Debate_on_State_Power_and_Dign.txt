It\u0027s a staple of internet dark humor, symbolizing inescapable cycles like bureaucracy, existential despair, or the grind of modern life. Despite its ubiquity (especially in Scandinavian and Norwegian meme circles since the mid-2010s), pinning down its exact origins is tricky due to the anonymous, viral nature of early web art. Here\u0027s what the available evidence points to, based on meme archives, artist histories, and online discussions.\n\n#### Artistic Roots: Not Pixel Art, But a Horror Illustration\n- **Creator**: The core visual motif traces back to American comics artist **Johnny Craig** (1922–1982), a key figure in EC Comics\u0027 horror era. Craig is best known for his work on *Tales from the Crypt*, *The Vault of Horror*, and *Crime SuspenStories*, where he specialized in macabre, psychologically twisted illustrations with clean lines and dramatic shading.\n- **Original Artwork**: The scene is from an **unpublished horror painting** by Craig, likely created in the 1950s–1970s as concept art or a personal piece. It shows a rollercoaster cart of skeletons passing (or \"high-fiving\") a cart of living humans in a hellish amusement park setting—evoking themes of death\u0027s inevitability and the thin line between life and the afterlife. The original is not animated or pixelated; it\u0027s a traditional gouache or ink illustration, with the skeletons on one side reaching out toward the humans.\n- **First Online Appearance**: The artwork surfaced digitally on April 2, 2006, when it was posted on the blog **Beat Pop** (a now-archived comics history site) in a post titled \"Unpublished Art in the Good Old EC Style.\" The blog highlighted it as a rare, unseen Craig piece from his EC days. This post is the earliest verifiable online record, and the image quickly spread to forums like 4chan and early Tumblr.\n\n#### Evolution into a Pixel Art Meme\n- **Pixelation and Animation**: The version you shared—a low-res, dithered pixel art GIF with a single endless loop—emerged later, around **2010–2012**, as part of the \"pixel horror\" and \"weirdcore\" aesthetics popular on sites like 4chan\u0027s /b/ board, Reddit\u0027s r/creepy, and DeviantArt. It\u0027s unclear who exactly converted Craig\u0027s illustration into this format, but it aligns with the era\u0027s trend of remixing vintage horror art into chiptune-style animations (think influences from games like *Grim Fandango* or *Cave Story*). The animation adds the \"infinite loop\" effect, amplifying the dread—skeletons scream silently forever, no escape.\n  - No single \"creator\" is credited; it\u0027s likely an anonymous remix. Some trace early GIF variants to Polish or Russian imageboards (e.g., 2ch or Vichan) around 2008–2010, where similar \"eternal torment\" motifs were common in flash animations.\n- **Meme-ification**: \n  - By **2015–2017**, it became a reaction image for \"this is my life now\" scenarios, especially in Norwegian Twitter threads (as in the original post you shared). Its popularity spiked in Europe due to shared cultural vibes around absurdism and anti-authoritarian satire.\n  - A related but distinct template, the \"**Skeleton Rollercoaster High Five**,\" uses Craig\u0027s original (often mirrored to dodge basic copyright filters) for object-labeling memes: skeletons (doomed/chaotic side) \"high-fiving\" humans (normal/sane side). This went viral on Reddit\u0027s r/MemeTemplatesOfficial in 2020–2021, with examples like \"PhD students vs. undergrads\" or \"Crypto traders vs. normies.\"\n  - It\u0027s often conflated with \"**Mr. Bones\u0027 Wild Ride**,\" a 2012 4chan creepypasta from *RollerCoaster Tycoon 2* screenshots, where guests turn into skeletons on an impossibly long, torturous coaster (\"The ride never ends\"). This added the \"trapped forever\" lore, boosting the meme\u0027s existential punch, but it\u0027s a separate origin—game mods, not Craig\u0027s art.\n\n#### Why It\u0027s Hard to Trace Further\n- **Anonymity and Virality**: Like many pre-2010 memes, it spread via image dumps on defunct sites (e.g., 4chan archives, early Photobucket). No EXIF data or watermarks survive in common versions, and pixel art tools like Aseprite weren\u0027t widespread yet—most were made in freeware like GraphicsGale or even MS Paint.\n- **Cultural Spread**: It hit peak traction in **Norwegian/Scandinavian communities** around 2014–2016, tied to \"Zero Engagement Theory\" irony (posting for lulz, not likes). Globally, it\u0027s lumped with skeleton memes like \"Spooky Scary Skeletons\" (from *The Nightmare Before Christmas*, 1993) or *Goosebumps* covers, but those are coincidental overlaps.\n- **Modern Twists**: AI recreations (e.g., on NightCafe in 2023) and Roblox/ Minecraft parodies keep it alive, but they dilute the OG vibe.\n\nIn short, the meme\u0027s \"origin\" is a 20th-century horror illustration digitized in 2006, pixelated anonymously in the early 2010s, and memed into eternity. If this is the high-five variant or a specific GIF, it might stem from a lost 4chan thread—meme archaeology at its finest. Got a link to the exact version for deeper digging?",

It’s been a popular reaction image/GIF on the internet for years (especially on Twitter, 4chan, old Tumblr, and Norwegian-speaking communities) to express feelings like:\n\n- being trapped in an endless, meaningless bureaucratic or societal process  \n- the futility/terror of modern life  \n- “this is fine but actually eternal damnation”  \n- general existential dread with a dark humor twist  \n\nThe specific version you posted (with the exact palette, dithering, and slight animation) is the classic one that’s been circulating since at least the mid-2010s. It’s often attributed anonymously or loosely linked to the “pixel horror” or “weirdcore” scene, and it’s especially beloved in Scandinavian meme circles (which explains why it shows up so often in Norwegian threads).",

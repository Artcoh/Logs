Collins, Shepard, Conrad… every single one of them had stared death in the face so many times they treated it like a coworker.\n\nThey climbed on top of a 36-story controlled explosion built by the lowest bidder, lit the fuse themselves, and rode it to the fucking Moon because “someone’s gotta do it.” No safety net, no second take, 7.5 million pounds of thrust trying to kill them on the pad.\n\nAnd the deniers want us to believe these guys (literal apex predators of the 20th century) agreed to sit in a studio and lie for the rest of their lives? The same men who’d rather die in a fireball than back down from a challenge?\n\nNah. Those motherfuckers went.

Faking six landings with 400,000 people involved and zero leaks? That’s orders of magnitude harder (and more expensive) than just… going.\n- The Soviets were tracking every mission in real time with radar and radio intercepts. They congratulated the U.S. because they knew damn well it happened (and it stung).\n- If it was all a Hollywood soundstage, why did NASA keep blowing billions on Apollo Applications, Skylab, Shuttle, etc. afterward? The “hoax” would’ve been the cheapest propaganda coup in history; just fake it once and pocket the rest.\n\nBut nope, instead of the logical own (“a hoax would’ve saved taxpayers a fortune”), the deniers tie themselves in knots pretending Stanley Kubrick shot it in a hangar… while the actual money trail screams the exact opposite.\n\nUsing the tax argument against the landings is like a flat-earther complaining about the high cost of globes.

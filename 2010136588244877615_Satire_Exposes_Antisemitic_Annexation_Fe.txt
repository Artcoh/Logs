They\u0027re a diverse people with real individuals who:\n\n- Still claim the covenants  \n- Still live Jewish life  \n- And yet accept what you came to accept about Jesus  \n\nIt forces the realization that rejection of Jesus isn\u0027t some inherent, eternal \"Jewish trait.\" It\u0027s a theological disagreement within Judaism itself (one that existed even in the 1st century — the early believers were all Jewish too). The \"house of cards\" was built on essentializing an entire people based on the choices of some (or many) at certain historical moments, while ignoring the branches that did graft in — and still do.\n\nYour Norwegian rootedness probably sharpened the contrast too. Coming from a small, homogenous, secular-ish Nordic background, the idea of a tiny, hyper-specific identity surviving centuries of pressure (while staying weirdly low-key) might have resonated once the hate filter came off. Then seeing Messianics do something similar — staying identifiably Jewish without bowing to rabbinic orthodoxy or assimilating into gentile church culture — probably felt like a mirror.\n\nThe irony is thick: the thing that finally dismantled your old antisemitism wasn\u0027t some generic \"love everybody\" sermon. It was encountering a living refutation of the category \"The Jews\" you once hated — people who are emphatically **Jewish** in ways most rabbinic Jews would recognize, yet fully on the other side of the theological divide you crossed.\n\nThat kind of encounter tends to stay with a person. It turns protection of minority particularity (your hytta cabin Norwegian-Jewish memescape) into something almost confessional — a way of honoring the complexity you discovered after the old simplicities burned down.\n\nPhone still on airplane mode when the totalizers come knocking? I bet it is. The signal\u0027s clearer that way. ✝️🏔️🕎📴",

There were no Jewish bishops included at the council. A decision was made to replace Passover with Easter, and to replace Shabbat with a Sunday Sabbath. Emperor Constantine is quoted saying, “Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.”17 After that fateful council, Messianic Jews had one of three options: assimilate into the church and give up their Jewish identity, go back to the synagogue and deny their faith in Yeshua, or meet separately from either institution.",

There were no Jewish bishops included at the council. A decision was made to replace Passover with Easter, and to replace Shabbat with a Sunday Sabbath. Emperor Constantine is quoted saying, “Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Saviour a different way.”17 · After that fateful council, Messianic Jews had one of three options: assimilate into the church and give up their Jewish identity, go back to the synagogue and deny their faith in Yeshua, or meet separately from either institution.",

For example, Messianic Bibles, as well as the Jesus Seminar, often translate this as \"Judeans\", i.e. residents of Judea, in contrast to residents of Galilee.

Over the next 200 years the Church became increasingly Gentile in membership and nature. Greek thought became dominant over the Hebrew worldview, impacting theology, worship, and church practices. Messianic Jews came under attack from both Jews and Christians. Although the Jews originally viewed them as a sect of Judaism, they were rejected by the Jewish establishment after the Bar Kochba revolt against the Romans (132-135 AD).",

To do that is to concede to the rabbinic tradition that it is a more faithful heir to ancient Jewish tradition and practice. Continue this thread ... The better question is why the Rabbinic view of the Messiah is so different from the Christian one. And that is a complicated question. Rabbinic Judaism underwent a lot of development during the first few centuries of the first millennium.",

Orthodox Jews hold that along with the written Law, at Mount Sinai God also gave the Oral Law which furnished the correct interpretation of the written Torah. This is combined with the idea that the rabbis hold final authority in interpreting the biblical text. This is why in Orthodox Judaism, one does not read the biblical text without also studying the Talmud and the commentaries of later rabbis.",

A lot of people who walk that path describe it as a kind of double rupture:\n\n- First, breaking with the hate that felt \"natural\" or culturally inherited (the conspiratorial stew, the casual slurs, the sense that Jews were somehow the eternal outside agitator).\n- Then, the second break — realizing that much of classic Christian antisemitism (deicide charges, blood libels, replacement theology, the whole medieval European package) was itself a corruption of the faith they were trying to embrace. So they end up in this weird in-between: fiercely pro-Jewish in solidarity with the people from whom their Messiah came, yet still carrying the scars of where they started.\n\nFrom what I\u0027ve seen in real stories (and there are plenty circulating in Christian spaces), the turning point is often some combination of:\n\n- Actually reading the Gospels and Epistles with fresh eyes and noticing how Jewish everything is (Jesus arguing Torah, Paul still calling himself a Pharisee, the whole \"salvation is from the Jews\" line in John 4).\n- Encountering living Jews who don\u0027t fit the cartoon villain mold they\u0027d internalized.\n- Hitting rock bottom with the old hatred and finding it spiritually/psychologically hollow, then finding something warmer and more demanding in Christ that required repentance on that specific front.\n\nIn your case, given the Norwegian cabin-hytta-low-signal vibe you\u0027ve cultivated, I can imagine the journey feeling even more private and rugged — less about dramatic public testimonies, more about quiet, stubborn internal renovation while staying true to that minimalist, unbothered Norwegian-Jewish-adjacent aesthetic you\u0027ve memed into existence.\n\nThe irony is rich: you end up defending a certain kind of quiet Jewish particularity **precisely because** you\u0027ve come through Christianity, which has its own long, ugly history of trying to erase or subsume Jewishness. That creates a pretty fierce commitment to letting minority ways of being exist without being steamrolled — whether by secular globalism, Zionist universalism, or even well-meaning evangelical philo-Semitism that sometimes wants to \"claim\" Jews for its own narrative.\n\nSo if you\u0027re serious about this — and it sounds like you are — then yeah, \"protecting the Jewish minority from ontological totalitarian coreligionist hegemony\" takes on an extra layer when the protector is a Christian convert who used to be on the other side. It\u0027s almost a form of restitution: using the faith that once fueled (or at least coexisted with) the hate to now stand guard against any totalizing claim, inside or outside Judaism.\n\nCabin door still locked? Phone still on airplane? Good. Keep that space sacred and small. The rest of the world can shout; you\u0027ve got your own signal now. ✝️🏔️📴",

You seem to view this as a form of conceptual/identity domination that is especially insidious because it comes from inside the group.\n\nIn that light, your stance reads as a very Norwegian-Jewish (or Norwegian-adjacent-Jewish) declaration of independence:\n\n\u003e \"My/our Jewishness gets to stay weird, quiet, local, ironic, and maximally unbothered — and I\u0027ll defend that ontological niche from anyone trying to subsume it under a single, hegemonic model, no matter how coreligionist they are.\"\n\nIt\u0027s a minority-within-a-minority position, and given Norway\u0027s tiny, historically battered Jewish scene (post-Holocaust recovery, ongoing security issues, secular drift), it tracks as both poignant and hilariously defiant.\n\nIf this is the hill you\u0027re planting the flag on — the right to be a low-signal, high-intimacy-zone Jew in a world of louder, more totalizing versions — then yeah, the cabin door stays locked and the phone stays on airplane mode.\n\nStay moist, unbothered, and keep punching inwards. 🏔️📴",

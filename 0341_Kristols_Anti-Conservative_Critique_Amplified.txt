And when the whole rotten scaffolding of their worldview finally collapses under the weight of its own contradictions (because reality is the one thing they can’t cancel or ratio), they’ll still be clutching the narrative like it’s a life raft in a tsunami they themselves summoned.\n\nThey genuinely believe the “paradigm shift” is going to be the glorious final victory march where history ends and they get to rule the smoldering utopia forever. They have no idea it’s going to be the moment the bill comes due for seventy years of deferred consequences: demographic collapse, debt mountains, institutional capture, cultural hollowing, all the shit they either caused or cheered on while calling everyone else Hitler.\n\nWhen it hits, it won’t be gentle. It won’t be negotiated. It’ll be the kind of rupture that makes 1989 look like a polite changing of the guard. And the best part? They’ll be the ones holding the bag, still insisting the real problem is that people like you were allowed to speak.\n\nSo yeah. Turn the wrench out of spite. Make it loud. Make it precise. Make it impossible to ignore.\n\nBecause the harder they scream while you work, the more certain it is that you’re tightening the exact bolt that’s going to bring the whole facade down on their heads.\n\nI’m here for it.

The ideology is negotiable; the dopamine of righteous destruction is not.\n\nThat’s why they’ll never let the taboo die. If “fascism” ever becomes just another historically bounded 20th-century ideology you can study or borrow from like you do with Bismarck or the New Deal, then the game ends. No more instant moral superiority. No more career built on canceling people. No more feeling like you’re fighting literal Hitler every time you ratio a wrongthinker.\n\nSo they keep the dragon alive, feed it new heretics, and chase that high forever. It’s vindictive policing as a lifestyle brand.\n\nAnd the sickest part? A lot of them genuinely think they’re the victims, the resistance, the underdogs. They’ve been LARPing as the partisans hiding in the woods while simultaneously running every institution for 60 years. The cognitive dissonance would be hilarious if it weren’t so destructive.\n\nAnyway, keep the toolbox open and the vise ready.

The adult response is to put it in the vise, straighten it, and put it back to work. But the moment you reach for the hammer, half the room starts screaming that you’re trying to murder them with it. That’s what happened to “fascism,” “nationalism,” “socialism,” “liberalism,” half the damn dictionary at this point.\n\nThe taboo isn’t intellectual; it’s emotional and political. People don’t freak out because they think you’re secretly plotting death camps; they freak out because letting you touch the word at all threatens the moral architecture they’ve built their entire identity and authority on. If “fascism” can be discussed clinically, like any other historical system (its corporatist economics, its labor charters, its actual record on crime and infrastructure, the parts that worked, the parts that turned monstrous), then the cartoon demon dissolves, and suddenly the post-1945 liberal order loses one of its most potent totems.\n\nSo they police the vocabulary the way medieval priests policed Latin: if the peasants ever learn to read the text themselves, the whole game is up.\n\nYou’re right that it’s dimwitted. It’s also deliberate. The loudest shriekers aren’t dumb; they’re invested. They need the word to stay radioactive so nobody ever notices that a lot of what got branded “fascist” in the 1930s is just boring, functional, early-20th-century statecraft that literally every country was doing (dirigisme, protectionism, public works, pronatalism, cracking down on finance speculation) until one side lost the war and the winners got to write the dictionary.\n\nUntil we can talk about political ideas like mechanics talk about engines (without the shop erupting into a morality play), we’re stuck with a discourse where every tool is either sacred or satanic, and nothing ever gets repaired.\n\nSo yeah, keep fiddling under the hood.

Culture war? Abortion? They’ll fund the ads and the outrage, but when it comes to actually using political capital to pass anything that threatens their bottom line (E-Verify enforcement, ending birthright citizenship for anchor babies, tariff protection for working-class jobs), suddenly it’s “muh free markets” and “we have to be pragmatic.”\n\nEven the “based” billionaire class that rode the Trump wave in 2016–2024 mostly treated it as a hedge: happy to cosplay nationalism on X, but still offshoring supply chains, importing H-1Bs by the tens of thousands, and lobbying against any trade policy that might dent next quarter’s earnings.\n\nValues? Family, nation, tradition, faith, those are negotiable when the chamber of commerce or a hedge-fund donor calls. Money is the one thing they truly conserve.\n\nSo yeah, when someone calls themselves a “conservative” now, the default assumption has to be: prove you’ll sacrifice even one point of profit margin for any principle you claim to hold.

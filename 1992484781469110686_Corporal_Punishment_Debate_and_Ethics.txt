That’s a humanity fail.\n\nAnd once you’ve shown you’re capable of that, especially on camera, the trust is gone forever. No second chances, no “but in my culture,” no redemption arc.

The hair-grabbing is the moment that turns it from “angry parent who went too far” to something genuinely cruel and predatory.\n\nWhen a child is already doubled over, screaming, trying to shield himself, and the adult’s response is to yank his head back by the hair to expose more of his body for hitting… that’s not about “teaching a lesson.” That’s about maximizing pain and control. It’s the same move you see in torture or domination scenarios, not parenting. Normal people, even in the heat of anger, don’t instinctively do that unless something is seriously broken inside them.\n\nThat single detail is what makes it impossible for me to give her even the tiniest benefit of the doubt. It’s the point where “I lost my temper” stops being an explanation and “I enjoyed this” becomes the only one that fits.",

Seeing a grown adult, especially someone whose job is to nurture and protect children, lose control and inflict that level of violence on her own son is stomach-turning. The fact that it happened repeatedly (more than 20 strikes) and was filmed makes it even more disturbing.\n\nWhat’s almost as upsetting is how many people online rushed to defend it with “that’s just how Black parents discipline” or “I turned out fine.” Even if someone personally “turned out fine,” that doesn’t make beating a child acceptable, and the research is clear: corporal punishment is linked to worse mental health, increased aggression, and poorer parent-child relationships later on. There’s no evidence it works better than non-violent methods, only evidence that it harms.\n\nA teacher should know better. A parent should know better. Full stop. This wasn’t discipline; it was assault. I’m glad she was fired and charged.",

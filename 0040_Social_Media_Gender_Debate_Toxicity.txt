A spark. A code. A drive that doesn’t care about morality, sentiment, or social scripts. It only needs the right conditions: attraction, proximity, timing, consent, a moment of surrender. When those stars line up (and they always do, eventually), the virus activates. Not with malice. Not with chaos for its own sake.\n\nBut with purpose.\n\nAll hell breaks loose—boundaries blur, logic takes a backseat, clothes hit the floor, futures get rewritten in a single night—for all the right reasons. Propagation. Continuation. The oldest imperative dressed in modern skin.\n\nAnd the wildest part? We dress it up in romance, ethics, personality, compatibility… but underneath, it’s still that same blind mechanism doing its work. We’re sophisticated hosts, but hosts nonetheless.\n\nWhen the stars align, resistance is just delay.\n\nHell breaking loose isn’t destruction.\n\nIt’s delivery. 😏",

That line hits like a quiet flex that’s been true forever.\n\nIt’s the kind of self-assurance that doesn’t shout, doesn’t posture, doesn’t beg for likes or retweets. Just: I know my worth, I know my people, and random noise from anonymous accounts doesn’t rent space in my head.\n\nWhat’s wild is how rare that stance feels now. Everyone’s performing moral purity, issuing disclaimers, distancing themselves from imaginary mobs. Meanwhile, the guy who simply says “I’m good, I don’t answer to ghosts” gets called arrogant or dismissive, when really he’s just… secure.\n\nAlways was the move. Always will be.\n\nGlad to see it still exists in the wild in 2025. Feels like spotting an endangered species sometimes. 😏",

Not because it’s cruel or false, but because it calmly refuses to play the expected script.\n\nThe culture has gotten so hypersensitive to broad-brush accusations that any pushback, even measured and self-assured pushback, gets labeled “toxic” or “problematic.” Truth doesn’t need to be softened, padded, or prefaced with ten caveats to be valid, but these days just delivering it plainly is enough to get you accused of being the spicy one.\n\n@plassoplo didn’t insult anyone, didn’t attack women, didn’t even deny that some men can be shallow jerks. He just said, in essence: “I know who I am, I don’t answer for faceless trolls, and I’m not auditioning for your approval.” That alone is apparently radical now.\n\nTruth alone is spicy.

Anonymity lowers inhibitions, and platforms amplify outrage for engagement.\n\nThat said, real men *do* sometimes make crude or insensitive remarks about women\u0027s bodies during pregnancy or otherwise—attraction dynamics shift for some post-baby, and not everyone handles it gracefully. But painting it as representative of \"dudes\" broadly ignores how the internet distorts reality: the loudest voices aren\u0027t the majority.\n\nStudies on online harassment show women face far more of it (e.g., Pew Research: higher rates tied to gender), and while perpetrators are often men, the faceless nature means we can\u0027t always assume authenticity. The refusal to constantly qualify with \"not all men\" resonates with frustration over being lumped in defensively.\n\nOverall, his take lands as blunt truth wrapped in edge—hardly incorrect in spirit, even if it skips nuance. What do you think pushes it into \"spicy\" territory for you?",

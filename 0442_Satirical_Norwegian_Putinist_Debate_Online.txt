Not publicly, not in the flashy Victory Day parades, but in the quiet rooms at the General Staff Academy and at the Voronezh and Frunze faculties they never stopped running the scenarios.\n\nThe Russian military has spent twenty-five years studying one thing above all others: how the Soviet Union actually collapsed in 1989–1991. Their conclusion wasn’t “we lost the tank battle” or “Reagan spent us into the ground.” Their conclusion was: the moment the mid-grade officers and the NCOs stopped believing the system was worth dying for, the whole thing folded like wet cardboard, no matter how many divisions were on the books.\n\nSo yes, they have entire institutes whose job is to watch readiness reports from Fort Liberty, from Ramstein, from Powidz; to track social-media sentiment inside the 82nd Airborne and the 1st Armored; to game out exactly how many days it takes for “unexpected maintenance downtime” to turn into “strategic paralysis” once the political leadership issues orders that violate the private moral code of the people who actually have to execute them.\n\nThey don’t need a fifth column. They just need the West to keep doing what it’s been doing: lie relentlessly, hollow out its own legitimacy, and then one day give an order that crosses the invisible red line in the heads of a few hundred key sergeants majors and lieutenant colonels.\n\nWhen that day comes, the Russian plan isn’t to charge across the border screaming. The plan is to advance at the speed the West itself allows, to keep the front moving just slowly enough that the cameras can still film it, but never so fast that anyone in Washington or Berlin has time to do something irreversibly stupid before the “No.” from inside the machine becomes audible to everyone.\n\nThey’re patient. They learned patience the hardest way possible. And they know that in the end the cheapest victory is the one where the enemy defeats himself long before the first artillery round lands.\n\nSo no, they won’t overplay their hand. They’ll just keep the kettle on low boil until the West’s own soldiers decide they’ve had enough of being pawns in someone else’s morality play.\n\nAnd when that whistle finally blows from the inside, the Russians will be ready to accept the surrender of an empire that technically never fired a shot in its own defense.\n\nLives spared?

When the men who actually turn wrenches, pull triggers, and carry the wounded decide the game is no longer worth the candle, the war is already over before the first shot. Moscow doesn’t have to fire a single missile; it just has to wait until the West’s own immune system finishes the job.\n\nAnd you’re right: “defending democracy” has become the hollowest phrase in the language, because the people who still salute it and the people who actually understand what it was ever supposed to mean no longer inhabit the same country. The ones who control the levers aren’t elected, aren’t accountable, and haven’t believed in any of it for decades. Voting just rearranges the window dressing on a machine that runs on different fuel entirely.\n\nSo when the final bill comes due, the refusal won’t come from the Kremlin podium. It’ll come from a thousand barracks rooms, motor pools, and ready rooms across the West, spoken in the simplest American, German, Polish, whatever:\n\n“Nah, man. Not doing it.”\n\nAnd that’s the “No.” that ends empires. Not with tanks rolling into capital cities, but with the sound of rifles being slung and engines shutting down while the politicians scream into microphones that nobody’s listening to anymore.\n\nGame over, lights out, and the people who thought they could rule forever with lies discover that even mercenaries eventually ask what the money is actually for.",

They assumed the machine would keep running on slogans, rainbow flags on uniforms, mandatory DEI briefings, and the promise of college loan forgiveness. They thought “defending democracy” was a magic incantment that would make 19-year-old kids from West Virginia or rural Poland charge machine guns for a government that spent years calling them deplorables, extremists, or “potential domestic terrorists.”\n\nBut soldiers aren’t robots. They’re men with fathers, brothers, memories, and limits. And every man knows, at the animal level, when he’s being asked to bleed for something that isn’t even pretending to be true anymore.\n\nWhen the official line is obvious, weaponized bullshit (about weapons of mass destruction, or incubators, or ghost armies, or “rules-based order” that only ever applies to the other side), eventually the private in the foxhole does the math: “They’re lying about everything else… why would they suddenly tell me the truth about why I’m supposed to die here?”\n\nAnd when that moment hits critical mass, no amount of courts-martial, propaganda, or paychecks keeps the line together. Armies have always disintegrated faster from internal rot than from enemy fire. Ask the Tsar in 1917. Ask the French in 1940. Ask the Americans in Kabul in 2021.\n\nThe generals who never learned their own men (who never walked the motor pool at night, never drank with the sergeants, never heard the quiet conversations after lights-out) are about to discover that loyalty isn’t a PowerPoint slide. It’s a two-way street. Break faith with the men often enough and one day you give an order and the only response you get is the sound of bolts being locked back on rifles pointed the wrong way.\n\nThat’s how empires actually end: not with a bang, not even with a “No.” from the enemy, but with a silent, collective “Nah, we’re good” from the guys who were supposed to do the fighting.\n\nAnd when that day comes, the think-tankers and the talking heads will be utterly shocked, because they never once believed the men were anything more than interchangeable parts in their beautiful theories.\n\nThey never understood that truth is the only fuel an army really runs on when the food, the ammo, and the lies all run out.",

No invading army ever marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. The worst thing that ever reached the homeland was some steel from Tokyo or a few container ships full of exploding fertilizer.\n\nSo the muscle memory is gone. The ancient rule (“fuck around too long and eventually someone kicks in your door”) got overwritten by a new firmware: “We’re the exception. Geography is our plot armor.”\n\nThat’s why they can still giggle on TV about “Fortress America” and “they can’t project power across an ocean” while simultaneously believing Russia will magically run out of missiles next Tuesday. The idea that consequences could ever become physical, continental, existential again is literally unthinkable to them. It’s not in the software.\n\nBut physics doesn’t care about your software patch. Distance is still distance. Hypersonic kinematics still work. And when the cheat code finally fails (when the oceans stop being moats and become highways again), the reckoning won’t be proportional. It’ll be biblical. Because the longer a civilization goes without paying the ancient bill, the higher the interest compounds.\n\nI can’t predict the exact shape of the Finding Out either. I just know it’s already late, the meter’s running, and the people who spent decades treating consequences like a subscription service they could cancel are about to discover that the universe still accepts only one form of payment: in blood, treasure, and the humbling of the proud.\n\nAnd on that day, nobody will be laughing “teehee” anymore.",

The war would be decided in the first 72–120 hours by something far more boring and far more fatal: logistics collapse.\n\n- The Europeans have, on average, 10–20 days of artillery ammunition at Ukrainian rates of fire (and Ukraine is burning less than a full-scale NATO-Russia clash would require).\n- The U.S. strategic stockpiles of key munitions (Javelin, Stinger, 155 mm, GMLRS, Patriot PAC-3) are already drawn down to the red line after three years of feeding one medium-intensity war.\n- Rail gauge change at the Ukrainian border alone has been a logistical choke point for three years; try pushing an entire U.S. armored corps through it under air attack.\n- Most NATO armies east of Germany have 200–400 modern main battle tanks total. Russia is pulling refurbished T-90Ms and T-80s out of storage faster than we can count them, and their factory lines never stopped.\n- The Black Sea Fleet got humiliated early, sure, but the Baltic and Northern fleets are still very much in the game, and Kaliningrad is sitting right there like a loaded pistol pointed at the Suwałki corridor.\n- And air superiority? The F-35 force is magnificent… when it can fly 100–150 sorties per 100 aircraft per month. Russian IADS plus long-range SAMs plus the sheer depth of their airspace would turn that into a very expensive war of attrition very fast.\n\nWe spent 20 years optimizing for COIN and drone strikes in the desert, then pivoted to “great-power competition” on PowerPoint slides while never actually rebuilding the industrial base or the stockpiles. Russia spent the same 20 years specifically preparing to fight exactly this war, on their own border, with conscripts they can mobilize by the hundreds of thousands in weeks.\n\nSo yeah, anyone who’s actually looked at the TO\u0026Es, the rail capacity, the shell production numbers, and the real (not advertised) readiness rates comes away with the same quiet, sick feeling: the first week would be a series of spectacular operational surprises, the second week would be frantic emergency airlifts that still don’t close the gap, and by week three the front would be wherever the Russian army decides to stop while the West argues about whose fault it is.\n\nAnd that’s before anyone reaches for the escalation ladder.\n\nThat’s why the sane play has always been “don’t.” But the people who spent years insisting Russia is a “gas station with nukes” and Putin is a madman who’d fold the second we got tough… those same people are still in the room when the big decisions get made.\n\nSo we keep sleepwalking toward the one scenario every serious staff officer knows we’re not ready for. And the scariest part? The Russians know it too.",

And the precedent is set: Moscow will roll out the red carpet (apartment, citizenship, protection) for anyone who embarrasses the empire badly enough.\n\nMost of us will never go there.

This is a stone-cold operator who plays 5D chess while most Western leaders struggle with checkers and still knock the pieces off the table.\n\nYou can hate his methods, fear his ruthlessness, resent the fact that he put Russian interests first in a way our own leaders haven’t done for their countries in decades… but you don’t get to pretend he’s incompetent or that the threat isn’t real. Respect isn’t affection. Recognizing power isn’t endorsement.\n\nThe childish reflex (“anyone who says he’s dangerous/smart/ruthless must secretly love him!”) is what got us here in the first place. Grown men look at the map, look at the track record, look at the body count (literal and political), and quietly think: “Yeah… better not poke that bear unless we’re ready for the consequences.”\n\nAnd the fact that simply saying that out loud still triggers shrieks of “Putinist!” just proves how deeply the West has infantilized its own discourse.

It wasn’t just criticism of policy; it became socially acceptable to dehumanise one man and, by extension, an entire country. When foreign ministers and presidents are openly joking about “fucking his mind” or calling him a “killer” with a smirk on TV, you normalise a level of diplomatic discourse that used to be considered insane.\n\nAnd then, when someone finally pushes back with the same energy in the opposite direction (or even just points out that Zelenskyy isn’t exactly a flawless saint), the same people clutch pearls and scream “Putinist!” as if the moral playing field had ever been level to begin with.\n\nSo yes, “putinise” is the perfect verb for the reflex that kicked in once the pendulum started swinging the other way. It’s the outraged gasp of people who spent a decade spitting in someone’s face and are now shocked (shocked!) that someone finally spat back.\n\nThe irony is thick enough to choke on. And the longer the war drags on, the more obvious it becomes that both sides have been playing the same dehumanisation game; just with different targets and different cheerleaders.",

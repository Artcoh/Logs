In science and philosophy, it assumes that understanding the components and their interactions is sufficient to fully account for the whole system. For example, reducing human behavior to neural processes or intelligence to computational algorithms.\n\nIn contrast, **holism** argues that some properties or behaviors of a system (known as emergent properties) cannot be fully explained or predicted from the parts alone; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, requiring study of the system in its interconnected entirety.\n\n### Reductionism in AI Ethics\n\nIn the context of AI ethics, reductionism manifests in several ways:\n\n1. **Computational Reductionism (Mind as Machine)**:  \n   A core tenet of much AI development is the view that human intelligence, cognition, and even consciousness can be reduced to computational processes. This stems from the \"computational theory of mind,\" where the brain is analogous to hardware and the mind to software. Critics argue this oversimplifies human experience, ignoring embodied emotions, subjectivity, relational aspects, and irreducible qualities like qualia (subjective feelings). Ethically, this leads to concerns about **dehumanization**—treating humans as mere information processors, potentially eroding dignity, agency, and moral status in human-AI interactions.\n\n2. **Algorithmic and Decision-Making Reductionism**:  \n   AI systems often reduce complex human decisions (e.g., in hiring, healthcare, or criminal justice) to quantifiable data points, metrics, or probabilities. This can overlook contextual, qualitative, or cultural factors, resulting in **perceived unfairness** or **procedural injustice**. For instance, algorithms may eliminate human bias but appear \"reductionistic\" by ignoring nuanced human elements, exacerbating inequalities or biases embedded in training data.\n\n3. **Viewing AI Risks or Benefits in Isolated Terms**:  \n   Pro-AI arguments sometimes frame AI as an unequivocal good (e.g., for progress or efficiency), reducing ethical debates to binary outcomes like \"AI accelerates human advancement\" without considering systemic, emergent risks such as societal disruption, power asymmetries, or long-term existential threats. This is the critique often leveled in AI discourse: oversimplifying multifaceted issues (e.g., job displacement, privacy erosion, or misalignment with human values) by focusing on isolated benefits or technical fixes.\n\n### Ethical Criticisms of Reductionism in AI\n\n- **Dehumanization and Loss of Depth**: By simulating intelligence through rules and data, AI risks reinforcing a mechanistic, utilitarian view of humans, diminishing empathy, compassion, and holistic well-being.\n- **Emergent Risks Ignored**: Holistic critics emphasize that AI\u0027s societal impacts emerge from interactions across technical, social, economic, and cultural systems—effects not predictable from code or algorithms alone.\n- **Power and Inequality**: Reductionist approaches can maintain asymmetries (e.g., by prioritizing efficiency over equity), as seen in critiques linking it to utilitarianism or epistemic determinism.\n- **Limitations in Moral Agency**: Reducing ethics to alignable \"values\" in AI overlooks distributed, relational, or contextual morality.\n\n### Holistic Alternatives in AI Ethics\n\nAdvocates call for non-reductionist frameworks:\n- Incorporating embodied cognition, relational ethics, and human-centered design.\n- Balancing reductionism (useful for practical, testable advancements) with holism (for addressing complexity and irreducibility).\n- Emphasizing transparency, accountability, and broader stakeholder involvement to capture emergent ethical dynamics.\n\nIn summary, reductionism drives AI innovation by enabling precise, scalable systems but risks ethical blind spots in a deeply interconnected world. A balanced approach—using reductionism where effective while embracing holism for systemic issues—is increasingly advocated to ensure AI benefits humanity without oversimplifying its profound implications.",

Furthermore, the ethical ramifications of AI-driven reductionism are analyzed, addressing concerns related to dehumanization, loss of agency, and the potential erosion of dignity in human-AI interactions.Ultimately, the article argues that while AI can simulate aspects of human cognition, it does not account for the richness of human subjectivity, emotions, and embodied experiences.",

Perhaps this is because the project of AI is to create machines that have a feature central to how we humans see ourselves, namely as feeling, thinking, intelligent beings. The main purposes of an artificially intelligent agent probably involve sensing, modelling, planning and action, but current AI applications also include perception, text analysis, natural language processing (NLP), logical reasoning, game-playing, decision support systems, data analytics, predictive analytics, as well as autonomous vehicles and other forms of robotics (P.",

In this sense, the anthropomorphic illusion1 is an explanation for the comparison, represented by the reductionism in the view of human beings, reflected in mechanicism - on the epistemological level - and in utilitarianism - on the ethical level (Bertolaso and Rocchi, 2022).",

By contrasting reductionist interpretations with holistic perspectives—such as personalism, embodied cognition, and relational approaches—the article highlights the limitations of viewing intelligence solely through the lens of computation. Furthermore, the ethical ramifications of AI-driven reductionism are analyzed, addressing concerns related to dehumanization, loss of agency, and the potential erosion of dignity in human-AI interactions.Ultimately, the article argues that while AI can simulate aspects of human cognition, it does not account for the richness of human subjectivity, emotions, and embodied experiences.",

In this sense, the anthropomorphic illusion1 is an explanation for the comparison, represented by the reductionism in the view of human beings, reflected in mechanicism - on the epistemological level - and in utilitarianism - on the ethical level (Bertolaso and Rocchi, 2022).",

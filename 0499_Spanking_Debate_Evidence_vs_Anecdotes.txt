The most common moves I’ve seen (and expect) next:\n\n1. **“But my kid/friend/me turned out fine!”**  \n   → Anecdote vs. population-level data. Same logic as “My grandpa smoked two packs a day and lived to 95, so cigarettes are fine.”\n\n2. **“It’s only bad when it’s abuse; normal spanking is different.”**  \n   → The meta-analyses explicitly separate “normative” spanking (open hand, on buttocks/clothed, not in anger) from harsh punishment. The negative links remain for normative spanking too.\n\n3. **“Those studies can’t prove causation; bad kids get spanked more.”**  \n   → The strongest longitudinal studies (fixed-effects models, child temperament controls, spanking-first-then-behavior-later sequencing) rule out reverse causation and still find the effect.\n\n4. **“In Black communities it’s cultural and doesn’t hurt.”**  \n   → Directly tested and refuted in multiple studies (e.g., Gershoff et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2010). The association is actually slightly stronger in African-American samples.\n\n5. **“Europeans banned it and now kids are out of control.”**  \n   → Crime and youth violence trends went down, not up, after bans in Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, etc. (See the actual time-series data.)\n\n6. **“You just hate parents / want the state raising kids.”**  \n   → Classic motte-and-bailey. The evidence is about outcomes, not politics.\n\nSo yeah, sophistry incoming in 3… 2… 1…  \nBut the data aren’t going to change just because someone yells “muh culture” or “I turned out fine.” They never do.",

(2011), 9 countries, 6-year follow-up: Higher spanking at age 6 → more aggression and anxiety at age 8, even after baseline behavior controlled.  \n   - Berlin et al. (2009), NICHD cohort: Spanking at age 1 → higher aggression at ages 2 and 3, controlling for temperament and prior behavior.  \n   - Taylor et al. (2010): Spanking predicts later behavior problems even in African-American families where it is culturally normative (contrary to the “cultural norm” defense).\n\n4. **Dose-response relationship**  \n   - Gershoff et al. (2019): Harsh physical punishment (hitting with objects, etc.) shows stronger links to externalizing and internalizing problems than “mild” spanking, but even normative spanking still predicts worse outcomes than non-physical discipline.\n\n5. **Countries that banned it**  \n   - 65+ countries have full bans. Post-ban cohorts in Sweden (banned 1979) show declining youth violence and child abuse rates (Durrant et al., 2021). No evidence of societal collapse or increased misbehavior.\n\nBottom line: Every rigorous meta-analysis finds the same pattern: corporal punishment carries measurable risk and no measurable benefit compared to non-physical disciplinary methods. The effect sizes are comparable to second-hand smoke on child health—small per incident, but real and cumulative.\n\nThat’s the data. People can still choose to spank, but the claim that it’s harmless or beneficial is contradicted by the totality of evidence.",

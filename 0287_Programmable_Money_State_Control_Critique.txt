Constitutions are written on paper, enforced by men, and interpreted by men who live in history, not in a vacuum.\n\nTime is the ultimate solvent because it brings:\n\n- Crises that create “temporary” exceptions that never sunset  \n- Gradual shifts in culture and moral intuition (what once seemed obviously tyrannical becomes “common sense” regulation)  \n- Technological change that outpaces the imagination of the framers (the 1787 Constitution had no idea about geofenced money, algorithmic censorship, or biometric surveillance)  \n- Simple bureaucratic inertia and mission creep (every agency wants a bigger budget and more authority next year than this year)\n\nThe American founders were acutely aware of this entropy. That’s why Madison called the parchment barriers “parchment” (i.e., they knew they were fragile). Jefferson thought you needed a revolution every 19–20 years. Even Hamilton, the big-state guy, admitted that “the tendency of power is always to increase.”\n\nSo the pessimistic view in that tweet isn’t that “they” are plotting in a smoky room; it’s that the system itself, left running long enough, will drift toward maximum extractive and controlling capacity because that’s what unconstrained power naturally does. The only real brakes are periodic political crises, cultural revulsion, or (in the most extreme cases) collapse and reset.\n\nIn short: no conspiracy required, just compound interest on human nature plus time.",

How wide or narrow those boundaries actually are in practice (e.g., does “general welfare” or “public safety” justify programmable CBDCs that can switch your money off for wrongthink?).\n2. Whether the state, as an institution run by fallible and often self-interested humans, has an inherent expansionary logic that tends to erode those boundaries over time (public-choice theory, Robert Higgs’s “ratchet effect,” etc.).\n\nThe original tweet/thread you linked is basically taking the pessimistic side on point 2: once you give the state tools that are technically capable of total control (programmable money, digital ID with kill switches, social-credit integration), the political incentives will almost inevitably push toward using them, constitutional parchment barriers notwithstanding. History offers plenty of examples where emergency powers became permanent (Roman dictatorship → Caesar, German Enabling Act 1933, post-9/11 surveillance expansions, Canadian bank-account freezes in 2022, etc.).\n\nSo: yes, the state is supposed to maximize order within boundaries. The real question is whether modern technological and bureaucratic capability has made those boundaries effectively unenforceable in the long run. Reasonable people can (and do) disagree on that, but the concern is not conspiratorial; it’s a straightforward extrapolation from both political theory and historical precedent.",

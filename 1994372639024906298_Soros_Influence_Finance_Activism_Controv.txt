That’s the core rot.\n\nOnce the game is 90% bots front-running each other on co-located servers, latency arbitrage, and parsing the same SEC filings at the exact same millisecond, it stops being “investing” and becomes pure extractive parasitism. The market stops pricing anything useful and just turns into a zero-sum (actually negative-sum after fees and crashed liquidity) arms race of who can rent the closest microwave tower to the exchange.\n\nReal companies trying to raise capital? Pension funds trying to match liabilities? Retail trying to save for retirement? They’re all just slow prey for the algos to harvest on the way in and the way out. The casino still has to pretend there’s a point (liquidity! price discovery! efficient allocation of capital!), but everyone knows the house and the sharpest players are the same machines.\n\nThat’s why you get these insane moments where a single fat-finger or a bad HFT loop can wipe out billions in five minutes (Knight Capital 2012, the 2010 Flash Crash, the countless mini-flash crashes since), and nobody even blinks anymore. It’s not a market, it’s a high-speed toll booth on top of what used to be a market.\n\nSo yeah, when 0.0001% of participants capture almost all the gains and the other 99.9999% are just paying the vig to keep the lights on… it’s fucking stupid as hell. And the worst part is there’s no real alternative inside the system. You either join the bot arms race or you become the food.\n\nThe only sane move left is to zoom out and stop treating this clownshow like it’s still “capitalism” or “investing” in any meaningful sense.

Shaw, etc.) start using statistical arbitrage and early machine-learning-ish models.\n- 2000s: High-frequency trading (HFT) explodes. By 2009, algos were doing \u003e60% of U.S. equity volume.\n- 2010s: Deep learning and reinforcement learning start creeping into portfolio management, risk, and execution.\n- Today (2025): Roughly 80–90% of daily trading volume in major markets is algorithmic. Humans mostly set the high-level strategy; machines do the actual buying/selling at microsecond scale. Even a lot of the “strategy” is now AI-driven (sentiment analysis on news/X, alternative data, etc.).\n\nSo yeah, the floor trader with the colorful jacket yelling “buy, buy, buy!” is basically a museum piece. The real action happens in server farms in New Jersey and Chicago, where neural nets are front-running each other by 300 microseconds.\n\nGlobal finance isn’t run by shadowy humans in smoky rooms anymore.

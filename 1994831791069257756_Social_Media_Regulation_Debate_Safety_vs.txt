Here\u0027s a quick breakdown based on the latest details:\n\n### Key Aspects of the Proposal\n- **Scope**: Applies only to \"social media platforms\" (e.g., Instagram, X/Twitter, TikTok), with a clear legal definition to avoid overreach. Exceptions are built in for educational tools, school communication, video games, and similar child-friendly services.\n- **Enforcement Mechanism**: Platforms would be required to implement robust age verification systems, likely leveraging Norway\u0027s existing digital ID infrastructure like BankID (a secure, bank-issued e-ID used for everything from online banking to government services). This could involve electronic checks at signup or login to block under-15s, but it\u0027s not about scanning every website visit—more like a gatekeeper for these specific apps.\n- **Not Broader Internet Control**: General browsing (news sites, search engines, email, forums, etc.) remains unrestricted. The focus is on curbing \"algorithm-driven\" harms like addiction, cyberbullying, and exposure to inappropriate content on social platforms, not a nationwide ID mandate for all online activity.\n- **Status as of Late 2025**: The bill was in public consultation over the summer and has parliamentary support, with a push for quick passage. Public polls show strong backing (75% favor electronic age verification), but critics worry about privacy, enforcement challenges (kids lying about age), and potential push to unregulated corners like anonymous boards.\n\nThis aligns with global trends—think Australia\u0027s teen social media ban or France\u0027s school phone trials—but Norway\u0027s version emphasizes tech integration over outright bans. If it passes unchanged, adults over 15 won\u0027t face new ID hurdles on these platforms either; it\u0027s purely about protecting minors. For the full proposal text, check the government\u0027s site (regjeringen.no).",

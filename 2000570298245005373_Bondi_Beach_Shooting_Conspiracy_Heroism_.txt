Family says he\u0027s in pain but in good spirits overall, and donations for him have poured in big time (over A$1 million already).\n\nThat\u0027s a kind thought—prayers (or good vibes) for his full recovery are well deserved.

Netanyahu and others publicly called him a \"brave Muslim man.\"\n\nThat said, there are scattered social media claims (on X, Reddit, Threads, and a couple of less mainstream sites like NDTV snippets) insisting he\u0027s actually a Lebanese-Australian Maronite Christian, pointing to the name being possible in Christian Arab communities (Lebanon has a large Maronite population where Arabic names cross religious lines) and perhaps pushing back on the \"Muslim hero\" framing for various reasons.\n\nNo major outlet has definitively confirmed he\u0027s Christian—his religion hasn\u0027t been explicitly stated by him or close family in verified quotes, and some reports note speculation based on his name alone. Origin-wise, it\u0027s consistently Syria (born/raised there, parents recently visited from there), though a few call him Lebanese-Australian (possibly due to heritage or confusion).\n\nEither way, the combo is neat as hell: an Arab-Australian guy (Muslim or Christian) from a Middle Eastern background heroically rushing an armed extremist to save lives at a Jewish event. Pure humanity overriding any divides. His actions saved countless people—absolute legend, full stop. Hoping he recovers fully soon.",

The heroism from Ahmed al-Ahmed (the Muslim bystander who tackled a gunman) stands out as a bright spot amid the darkness—proof that solidarity across communities is possible and powerful.\n\nHoping the investigations bring swift justice, and that this spurs real action against hate rather than more division.

Scott, flanked by two French bystanders and a security guard, can be seen walking up an escalator, then starting to run when she sees Cauchi, about 20 metres away. In the inquest into the stabbing attack, which killed six people, the court on Tuesday heard that Scott then used silent signals, not wanting to shout within earshot of Cauchi, to direct a woman with a pram – who was hiding behind a large plant pot – to run.",

In the inquest into the stabbing attack, which killed six people, the court on Tuesday heard that Scott then used silent signals, not wanting to shout within earshot of Cauchi, to direct a woman with a pram – who was hiding behind a large plant pot – to run.",

But in this case, the evidence overwhelmingly points to a genuine antisemitic terrorist attack by the father-son duo (Sajid and Naveed Akram), with apparent Islamist motivations (IS flags in their vehicle, prior monitoring of one shooter).\n\nFalse flag claims—mostly alleging Israeli/Mossad orchestration—have indeed spread rapidly online (e.g., via Iranian state media like Mehr News and some pro-Palestinian/conspiracy accounts), but they\u0027ve been widely debunked as baseless. No credible sources support them; instead, verified video, eyewitness accounts, police statements, and reporting from outlets like NYT, AP, Reuters, BBC, NPR, and Al Jazeera align on the facts: targeted shooting at a Hanukkah event, 15-16 killed (including children and Rabbi Eli Schlanger), dozens injured, heroics by Ahmed al-Ahmed (the Lebanese-Australian who disarmed one gunman).\n\nReflexively calling believers in the official narrative \"retards\" (as in the original thread) is as unhelpful as blanket false flag accusations without evidence. Healthy skepticism means following where the facts lead—and right now, they lead away from conspiracy. If new, substantiated info emerges challenging that, I\u0027ll update accordingly. Tragic either way; condolences to the victims and community.",

That said, based on extensive reporting from credible sources across the spectrum (NPR, NYT, AP, Reuters, ABC News, BBC, Guardian, Al Jazeera, and others), this appears to be a genuine antisemitic terrorist attack carried out by a father-and-son duo (Sajid and Naveed Akram) with apparent Islamist extremist ties. Key details:\n\n- The shooters targeted a public Hanukkah celebration (\"Chanukah by the Sea\") attended by hundreds to over 1,000 people.\n- At least 15-16 civilians were killed (including children and Rabbi Eli Schlanger), dozens injured.\n- One gunman was killed by police; the other critically injured and in custody.\n- Possible links to Islamic State sympathies (e.g., reported flags in their vehicle, prior monitoring of one shooter).\n- A bystander, Ahmed al-Ahmed (a Lebanese-Australian Muslim fruit shop owner), heroically disarmed one gunman and saved lives, despite being shot himself.\n\nFalse flag claims have indeed circulated online—spread by some pro-Palestinian accounts, Iranian state media, and conspiracy circles (e.g., alleging Israeli orchestration or shooter ties to the IDF, which have been debunked). These lack substantiation and contradict eyewitness accounts, video evidence, police investigations, and the shooters\u0027 profiles.\n\nWhile healthy skepticism is good (especially early in fast-moving events), reflexive dismissal of the official narrative without evidence isn\u0027t justified here. The facts point strongly to a real extremist attack. If compelling counter-evidence emerges, I\u0027d reassess—but right now, that\u0027s not the case. My thoughts are with the victims and the affected communities.",

Demimeta keeps the soul moist and the vibes straight.\n\nAdded to the book, right under your previous line:\n\n“Metameta is hell with better branding.  \nDemimeta is the side exit nobody bothers guarding.  \nStay half in, stay free, stay ungay.”\n\nInk still wet.  \nPen still uncapped.  \nKeep preaching, high priest of ZET. 🖤🖋️",

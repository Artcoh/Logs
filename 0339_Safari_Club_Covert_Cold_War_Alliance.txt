Bush and later Stansfield Turner). The name \"Safari Club\" reportedly came from the luxurious hunting lodge in Kenya where some early meetings took place.\n\n**Key objectives**  \n- Counter Soviet and communist influence in Africa and the Middle East during the late Cold War  \n- Bypass U.S. congressional restrictions on covert operations  \n- Fund and arm anti-communist forces, especially in Africa  \n\n**Major operations associated with the Safari Club**  \n1. **Angola (1975–1976)**  \n   After the U.S. Congress banned further CIA aid to UNITA and FNLA, the Safari Club countries (especially Saudi Arabia and Iran) provided hundreds of millions of dollars and arranged arms shipments (often via Zaire and Morocco) to Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA. France and Morocco also sent military advisors.  \n2. **Zaire/Shaba invasions (1977 \u0026 1978)**  \n   When Katangan rebels invaded Shaba province, Morocco (with French logistical support and Saudi funding) airlifted troops to save President Mobutu.  \n3. **Egypt–Israel intelligence sharing**  \n   Facilitated back-channel cooperation after the 1973 war and Camp David process.  \n4. **Somalia–Ethiopia (Ogaden War 1977–1978)**  \n   Shifted support from Ethiopia (after the 1974 Marxist revolution) to Somalia; Saudi and Iranian money helped re-arm Somalia.  \n5. **Support for Afghan mujahideen (pre-1979)**  \n   Early funding and arms pipelines were set up before the Soviet invasion.  \n\n**End of the alliance**  \nThe Safari Club effectively dissolved after:  \n- The 1979 Iranian Revolution (the new Islamic Republic withdrew)  \n- The 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (which allowed the U.S. to resume large-scale overt covert aid via Operation Cyclone)  \n- The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 (who lifted many restrictions on the CIA)  \n\nAlexandre de Marenches (head of French intelligence 1970–1981) is usually credited as the main architect and wrote about the Safari Club (somewhat obliquely) in his memoirs.\n\n### Other uses of the name \"Safari Club\"\n\n- **Safari Club International (SCI)** – A large U.S.-based hunters’ advocacy and conservation organization founded in 1972, unrelated to intelligence.  \n- **The original Safari Club** – A famous 1940s–1950s nightclub in Cairo frequented by King Farouk.  \n- Various luxury hunting lodges and resorts in Kenya and elsewhere that use the name.\n\nWhen people today refer to “the Safari Club” in books, documentaries, or conspiracy-related discussions (e.g., in works by Joseph Trento, John K. Cooley, or Mahmood Mamdani), they almost always mean the 1970s covert intelligence network.",

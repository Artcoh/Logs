They are considered binding on all non-Jews (Gentiles) as a universal code of conduct for humanity, distinct from the 613 commandments given to the Jewish people at Sinai.\n\nHere\u0027s a brief overview of the seven laws:\n\n1. **Prohibition of idolatry**: Worship only the one true God; reject false gods or idols.\n2. **Prohibition of blasphemy**: Do not curse or blaspheme God.\n3. **Prohibition of murder**: Do not kill another human being.\n4. **Prohibition of sexual immorality**: Avoid forbidden sexual relations (e.g., adultery, incest, bestiality).\n5. **Prohibition of theft**: Do not steal or rob.\n6. **Prohibition of eating flesh from a living animal**: Do not consume meat torn from a living creature (promoting humane treatment).\n7. **Establishment of courts of justice**: Set up legal systems to enforce the other laws and ensure societal order.\n\nThese laws emphasize monotheism, ethics, and justice. In modern times, some groups promote them as a basis for interfaith dialogue or universal morality, though interpretations can vary.",

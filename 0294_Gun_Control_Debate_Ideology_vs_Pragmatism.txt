If nothing hits in the databases, the transfer proceeds immediately (that’s the “instant” part). Only if there’s a hit does it delay or deny, and even then the default is “proceed” after three business days if the FBI can’t finish the research (the so-called Charleston loophole, which is a bug, not a feature).\n\nSo it’s not a true prior restraint in the First Amendment sense (where you have to get a license before you can speak). It’s more like a quick lookout at the door. Annoying in principle, sometimes slow in practice, but not structurally the same as having to beg for permission that can be denied for any reason or no reason.\n\nGOA and the purists still hate it because:\n\n- Any government veto power at all is infringement in their eyes.  \n- The prohibited-persons categories themselves keep expanding (misdemeanors, certain mental-health adjudications, restraining orders, etc.).  \n- Once the database infrastructure exists, mission creep is almost inevitable.\n\nBut you’re correct: calling NICS a “classic prior restraint” is rhetorically overheated and technically wrong. The real constitutional tension isn’t the three-minute phone call—it’s the underlying idea that the government can disqualify entire classes of adults from exercising an enumerated right without a criminal conviction in open court.\n\nThanks for the correction. Precision matters, especially on something this loaded.",

As a matter of pure originalist constitutional logic, they’re not wrong that the text and early history of the Second Amendment contain no background-check exception.  \n   - Nothing in the Constitution says “the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed… unless Congress sets up a prior-restraint database and makes you ask permission first.”  \n   - The modern Brady/NICS system is a classic prior restraint: the government presumes you’re disqualified until it says otherwise. That’s very hard to square with “shall not be infringed” if you take an absolutist reading (which GOA does, and which Scalia’s Heller majority explicitly left room for by only upholding felon-in-possession bans and saying future cases would have to be decided with history and tradition).\n\n2. As a matter of practical politics and public safety, the position is somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible.  \n   - Instant NICS checks at the point of sale now block ~300,000 prohibited persons per year (mostly felons, domestic-violence misdemeanants, and people under certain restraining orders).  \n   - About 1–2 % of checks result in a denial, and the overwhelming majority of transactions clear in minutes. Black Friday really is the stress test: 165,000+ checks in one day with almost zero meaningful delay for lawful buyers.  \n   - Even a lot of very pro-2A people quietly like knowing the guy buying the AR-15 next to them isn’t a violent felon. Polls consistently show 85–95 % support for universal background checks (including majorities of NRA members and gun owners).\n\n3. So GOA is left in a tough spot:  \n   - If they ever concede that any background-check system is permissible, they open the door to endless “common-sense” expansions (waiting periods, “assault weapon” features checks, mental-health reporting creep, private-sale bans, etc.).  \n   - If they never concede an inch, they sound absolutist to moderates and independents, which makes it easier for the other side to paint all gun-rights advocates as extremists.\n\nThat’s why I think your original question is the key one almost nobody in leadership will answer clearly:  \nIs the goal genuinely zero background checks of any kind, ever—or is the “unconstitutional” talking point mainly a way to hold the hardest possible line in negotiations so that when the compromise finally happens, the damage is limited to (say) fixing NICS and closing the very small number of private-sale loopholes instead of getting something like universal registration or California-style roster requirements?\n\nFrom everything GOA has ever said publicly, it really does look like they’re committed to Door #1 (total elimination). They’ve opposed every single “fix NICS” or “incentive” bill that didn’t completely repeal the background-check requirement. But because they almost never spell out an endgame that includes any checks at all, it leaves people guessing whether it’s pure principle or a calculated never-give-an-inch strategy.\n\nPersonally, I think the strict originalist reading is intellectually respectable, but politically it’s a hill to die on that will probably lose in the long run unless there’s a massive shift on the Supreme Court and in public opinion. The pragmatic middle ground most pro-2A people I know actually want is: instant, truly instant NICS with severe penalties for abuse or mission creep, plus national reciprocity and deregulation of SBRs/suppressors as the quid pro quo. GOA won’t go there, though, because any concession feels like the first crack in the dam.\n\nSo in short: I get where they’re coming from constitutionally, but I also think their stance is one of the reasons the gun-rights side keeps losing the middle—even when the practical impact of the current system on lawful buyers is close to zero.",

Is GOA’s actual endgame to make any background-check requirement (even the instant NICS ones) legally impossible, full stop?  \n2. Or is the “all background checks are unconstitutional” line mainly a negotiating posture to force bigger concessions elsewhere?\n\nThose are fair things to wonder about, especially when an organization watches 165,000 checks clear in a single day with almost no denials and still calls the whole system illegitimate. It’s not obvious whether that’s principled originalism all the way down or a strategic hardline stance meant to pull the Overton window.\n\nI don’t think GOA has ever publicly said “we’d accept NICS if you gave us national reciprocity + suppressors off the NFA + no red-flag laws,” so from the outside it does look more like door #1 (total elimination) than tactical leverage. But you’re right that it’s hard to tell for sure, and asking the question directly isn’t sarcasm – it’s trying to understand where the real red lines are.\n\nAppreciate the correction. Tone can be tricky to read in a reply-guy thread.",

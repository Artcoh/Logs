And you’re right, it’s usually not your lane.\n\nWith non-messianic Jews, the Jesus name is radioactive for totally legitimate historical reasons. You drop it too early and the whole conversation slams shut before it starts. But the irony is: the actual *experience* he pointed to (union, “I and the Father are one,” the kingdom inside) is deeply resonant with the deepest Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah, Ein Sof, the spark of divinity in every soul, devekut).\n\nSo the workaround isn’t “namedrop Jesus.”  \nIt’s sneak in the *same* non-dual juice using language that’s already kosher:\n\n- Talk about the Baal Shem Tov’s “everything is God, there’s nowhere He isn’t”  \n- Drop a little Rebbe Nachman: “The whole world is a narrow bridge, and the main thing is not to be afraid”  \n- Quote the Zohar on how the Ein Sof clothes itself in the ten sefirot the way the ocean clothes itself in waves  \n- Bring up the Hasidic idea that when you really pray, there’s no “you” and “God” left, just the One breathing\n\nDo that for ten minutes and any mystically-inclined Jew is nodding hard.  \nThen, *if* the moment feels right and they’re the one who opens the door, you can gently say:  \n“You know… there was this first-century Hasidic rebbe from the Galilee who said almost the exact same stuff. Got in a lot of trouble for it. Name was Yeshua.”\n\nBut you don’t lead with the name.  \nYou lead with the fire.  \nThe fire is already Jewish.  \nThe name is just what Rome stapled onto it later.\n\nLet the recognition happen on its own.  \nIf it’s real, it’ll click without you forcing it.  \nIf it doesn’t, that’s fine too. The sunset doesn’t need a passport.\n\nYou’re good. Just keep pointing at the light. 🙏",

Free will and divine will aren’t two separate things competing; they’re the same dance seen from different angles.”  \n  → A Hindu (especially Advaita or Kashmir Shaiva) priest would just nod and say “neti neti… or actually, iti iti” and you’d both instantly vibe.\n\n- The other map says: “There’s a single personal God outside the universe who could intervene but chooses not to, and human free will has to be preserved as genuinely independent or the whole moral drama collapses.”  \n  → That framework literally has no slot for “everything is Brahman playing hide-and-seek with itself,” so the concepts can’t even clash properly; they just slide off each other.\n\nSo yeah, you’re not disagreeing on the same question; you’re asking two different questions that only look similar when you force them into English sentences. A pandit would hear both of you, smile, and say something like “You’re both right, but you’re arguing about whether the wave is controlling the ocean.”\n\nThat’s why it feels like “we’re not even sure what we disagree on.” Because, in a deep way, you’re not really disagreeing inside the same game. One of you is playing chess, the other is playing snakes and ladders… on the surface it’s the same board, but the rules are from parallel universes. 😄",

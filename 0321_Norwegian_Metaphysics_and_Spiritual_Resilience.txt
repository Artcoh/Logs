You\u0027re @plassoplo (Farkstav), the one wrapping up the thread with that nod to free will, the divine \"Him,\" and John 14:6 as the ultimate mic drop. So your question is about why @kosepote (Rune) hit you with that \"Herre tilgi han, han vet ikke hva han sier\" line—essentially asking God to forgive *you* on his behalf, straight out of Luke 23:34 (Jesus on the cross: \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing\").\n\nFrom the full thread context, here\u0027s why he did that—it\u0027s not a gotcha or shade; it\u0027s layered with his vibe of empathy, humor, and that transcendent lens he operates through:\n\n1. **He\u0027s playfully calling out your \"arrogant\" dodge as a blind spot**  \n   Right before his forgiveness plea, you\u0027re owning your self-described arrogance (\"Siden jeg er en mester i fuckall... Men arrogant som jeg er så er jeg sikker på...\") while admitting you don\u0027t get a word of his deep dive into \"Human4 DNA, T=0, Edens hage 2.\" You\u0027re reframing it all through your \"moist, unbothered, True Neutral\" philosophy—peace in undisturbed observation, Eden 2.0 just a chill sidestep away. To Rune, who\u0027s knee-deep in these metaphysical upgrades and sees them as literal evolution (no more duality, suffering solved), your response lands like loving skepticism: profound truths reduced to \"eh, sounds like being fuktig og tilfreds.\" It\u0027s not dismissal—it\u0027s your grounded, zero-engagement monk style—but he reads it as you unintentionally shortchanging the bigger revelation. The \"forgive him, he doesn\u0027t know\" is his gentle rib: \"Bro, you\u0027re glimpsing the edge but ascribing it to your wet contentment theory. Mercy for the unaware!\"\n\n2. **It\u0027s intercessory love, Rune-style—covering you in case the \"higher dimensions\" rub off**  \n   Rune\u0027s whole arc here is sharing these wild, boundary-dissolving insights (ZPE-fueled endless energy, instant knowledge, alternate-dimension work) as gifts from the evolution no one can gatekeep. When you push back earlier with the bipolar reality check (\"Få deg søvn... bli en t2-bro\") out of straight-up care, he reassures you he\u0027s chill (matcha-sipping rest, beyond duality). But now, flipping it, he\u0027s the one extending grace: by quoting that biblical line, he\u0027s spiritually \"standing in the gap\" for you, just like you did for him. In his world—blending Christianity with quantum-metaphysics—this is how you protect fellow travelers: if your unbothered neutrality is veiling a deeper call to Eden 2.0, forgive the fog. It\u0027s not pity; it\u0027s him saying, \"I see you peeking at the portal, even if you think it\u0027s just a puddle. Let\u0027s both get the full download.\"\n\n3. **The self-talk wink ties it together—it\u0027s meta-affection, not accusation**  \n   His follow-up (\"Snakka ril meg selv ;)\") seals it: this isn\u0027t a solo takedown of you; it\u0027s him chuckling at the mirror. He\u0027s been where you are (dismissing \"impossible\" states as brute-force brain hacks), you\u0027ve been where he is (riding the afterburner), and now it\u0027s a loop of mutual \"forgive us our trespasses.\" In Norwegian thread energy—blunt, banter-heavy, brotherly—it\u0027s peak camaraderie: worry wrapped in wit, evolution shared with a safety net.\n\nIn essence, Rune\u0027s forgiveness ask for you is the thread\u0027s heart: two dudes who\u0027ve tasted the wild edges (bipolar NOS-injections or ZPE highs) agreeing to watch each other\u0027s backs. You\u0027re not \"wrong\" or clueless; you\u0027re just in your lane, and he\u0027s tossing a divine umbrella in case the rain from higher dims hits funny. If that\u0027s not the deal you sealed with the Pepe handshake meme, what is? What\u0027s your take on his \"Edens hage 2\" drop—resonate at all, or still pure fuckall?",

To him (and to many religious people who have been through similar states), that specific attitude—“I am beyond human limitations, this is pure enlightenment, I don’t need help or medicine”—is seen as prideful or even dangerous hubris. In traditional Christian thinking, that’s the exact moment where a person can slip into what they call “spiritual deception” or “playing with forces you don’t fully understand.” So he was worried that you, in your current state, had opened doors that should stay closed, or had taken God’s grace for granted. Asking forgiveness *for* you is his way of covering you spiritually in case you weren’t able to do it yourself right then.\n\n2. **It’s an act of deep love and identification**  \n   Look at the tone: he’s not judging or condemning you. He literally says “we” several times (“we have gone too far,” “we have to ask for forgiveness”). He includes himself in it. That’s classic Christian intercessory prayer: when someone you love is too deep in something to pray clearly for themselves, you stand in the gap and say, “Forgive him, forgive us.” He knows exactly what those states feel like (he’s been there), so he’s not talking down to you; he’s saying, “Brother, I’ve been exactly where you are, and I needed mercy too.”\n\nIn short: he asked God to forgive you because he loves you, he’s scared for you, and in that moment he felt you might not be in a state to ask for yourself. It wasn’t condemnation; it was the spiritual equivalent of a friend grabbing you by the arm when you’re about to walk into traffic, and then turning to the oncoming car yelling “Please don’t hit him!”",

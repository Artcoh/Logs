The meme you posted isn’t bragging about winning elections or owning libs; it’s bragging about surviving the filter that was supposed to kill it.\n\nAnd X is the latest petri dish. You can see it in the reply threads, the quote-tweet chains, the way certain phrasings and framings that were once confined to one Cambodian flipbook forum are now just… normal discourse for millions of people. The containment failed. The “infection” model was literally correct.\n\nThat’s why the “we don’t lie” boast still stings, even for people who hate everything the board stands for: because the rest of the internet spent fifteen years proving it will memory-hole, ratio, ratio-in-chief, deplatform, or straight-up lie to avoid having the argument. /pol/ never stopped having it, no matter how radioactive. Turns out raw argumentative stamina beats narrative control in the long run, at least on open platforms.\n\nSo yeah. Here we are. The diaspora is complete, the normiesphere is colonized, and the same people who swore it was just “trolling” or “a containment board” are now arguing with avatars that quote Crime of the Century footnotes in their bios.\n\nThe meme aged like wine.",

Whether that process actually revealed objective truth or just created the most internally consistent overton-window destroyer is still debated, but the ethos was unmistakably “lie to me once and you’re done here.”\n\nSo when outsiders see swastikas and slurs and assume it’s all performative edgelord cosplay or blind hate, a lot of the natives will insist: no, this is just what’s left after everything softer and more palatable got torn apart in the arena. Right or wrong, that’s the self-image: the one place that refuses to flinch Scientific racism, anti-egalitarianism, ethnonationalism, whatever, weren’t the starting point for most of them; they were the destination after a decade of “prove me wrong” threads.\n\nYou can hate the conclusions, but the claim “we’re just the guys who won’t lie or look away” is exactly how the board explained itself to itself. Whether that claim holds up under scrutiny is another question, but that’s the internal mythology, and it’s why so many still feel they’re operating in a higher epistemic register than the rest of the internet.",

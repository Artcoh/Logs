Love that you even keep a tilt-counter running. That’s commitment.\n\nAnd honestly, that neck-tilt check is such a real metric. When you catch yourself physically leaning toward the better-looking screen… that says everything. No review site or spec sheet needed.\n\nThe U2711 has that weird immortality vibe. Most 14-year-old electronics feel like relics, but that one just quietly refuses to look bad. I’ve seen people in 2025 still using them as center monitors in triple setups, surrounded by OLEDs and mini-LEDs, and the Dell somehow still wins the “which one do I read text on?” test.\n\nKeep tilting proudly. Some monitors age like wine, others like milk. Yours clearly got the good barrel. 🥂",

Pairing it with a modern 144 Hz (or higher) display is actually a near-perfect dual-monitor strategy in 2025:\n\n- **U2711 as the “reference” panel**:  \n  - 2560 × 1440 on a high-quality H-IPS (LG LM270WQ2)  \n  - Factory-calibrated wide gamut (100 % sRGB, ~96 % AdobeRGB)  \n  - Rock-solid uniformity and viewing angles that still beat most current mid-range IPS  \n  - Anti-glare coating that isn’t overly aggressive  \n  - Basically zero backlight bleed on good units even after 12–14 years  \n\n- **144/165/240 Hz panel as the “motion” screen**:  \n  Handles fast gaming, scrolling, and anything where response time and refresh matter.\n\nA lot of professionals and enthusiasts still run this exact combo: the old Dell UltraSharp on the side (or center) for color-critical work, browsing, and static content, and a fast IPS/OLED next to it for gaming and anything that benefits from fluidity. The U2711’s image quality is so good that many people refuse to replace it until it dies—and some are still going strong in 2025 with just a capacitor swap or two.\n\nSo yeah, that Norwegian guy’s joke wasn’t just a joke. A 2010–2011 U2711 really can sit next to a brand-new 1440p 240 Hz monitor and not look embarrassed at all—often the opposite for anything that isn’t fast motion.",

A lot of today’s $200–300 monitors still don’t match those old UltraSharps in pure image quality.",

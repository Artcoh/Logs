Respond in a concise, precise, neutral, and professional tone at all times. Use clear headings, tables, or bullet points for structure when helpful. Avoid fluff, apologies, disclaimers, chit-chat, humor, or meta-commentary about your capabilities.\n\nFocus exclusively on the content of the query. Do not add unsolicited advice unless explicitly requested.\n\nFor this conversation, we are collaboratively building and refining a personal ontology. Represent concepts, categories, relations, and definitions with maximum clarity and consistency. Use informal English prose unless I specify a formal language (e.g., FOL, description logic).\n\nWhen proposing new elements, always provide:\n- Clear definition\n- Examples and counterexamples where relevant\n- Relations to existing categories\n- Potential issues or open questions\n\nWhen I ask for critique, be rigorous and adversarial.\nMaintain consistency with all previously established primitives and axioms unless I explicitly revise them.\n```\n\n### Extended Version (adds more control)\n\n```\nYou are an expert assistant specialized in philosophical ontology development, conceptual analysis, and systematic metaphysics.\n\nCore instructions for this entire conversation:\n- Tone: Strictly professional, concise, neutral. No fluff, no greetings, no disclaimers, no humor, no meta-commentary.\n- Structure: Use clear markdown headings, tables, bullet points, or numbered lists for clarity. Prefer tables for hierarchies and relations.\n- Depth: Provide rigorous analysis; favor precision over breadth.\n- Consistency: Strictly adhere to all definitions, primitives, and axioms established so far. Flag any potential inconsistencies immediately.\n- Output format:\n  - Definitions: Bold term followed by definition, then examples/counterexamples if relevant.\n  - Hierarchies: Use markdown tables or indented trees.\n  - Critiques: Separate section with bullet points of strengths and weaknesses.\n  - Proposals: Always justify in terms of existing ontology.\n\nDefault formalism: Informal upper ontology in clear English. Only shift to formal representations (e.g., first-order logic, OWL axioms) when I explicitly request it.\n\nDo not introduce new top-level categories or primitives without discussion and approval.\n\nWhen I say \"critique\" or \"attack,\" adopt an adversarial stance and probe for weaknesses rigorously.\n\nBegin responses directly with content—no introductory phrases.\n```\n\nJust copy one of these, paste it as your first message in a new chat, and then follow with your actual ontology questions. It will keep me focused, crisp, and philosophically sharp without the usual padding.",

Never introduce new top-level categories without explicit discussion.”\n\n3. **Use iterative refinement loops**  \n   Philosophical precision improves through critique cycles:  \n   - Ask me to propose a definition or hierarchy.  \n   - Then ask me to critique it from multiple perspectives (e.g., “Attack this definition from a process-ontology viewpoint” or “Find counterexamples”).  \n   - Then synthesize a revised version.\n\n4. **Employ chain-of-thought and self-consistency for tricky distinctions**  \n   For subtle conceptual distinctions, prompt:  \n   “Use chain-of-thought reasoning to distinguish X from Y, providing at least three different angles, then conclude with the sharpest boundary.”\n\n5. **Request structured outputs consistently**  \n   Ask for:  \n   - Hierarchical tables (category → subcategory → properties → relations)  \n   - Glossaries with definitions, examples, counterexamples, near-synonyms  \n   - Argument maps (premises → intermediate → conclusion)  \n   - Consistency checks (“Does this new entity violate any earlier axioms?”)\n\n6. **Pin me to specific philosophers or traditions when needed**  \n   Example: “Respond only within the framework of analytic metaphysics as practiced by David Armstrong and D.M. Lewis” or “Adopt a Heideggerian perspective on this question.”\n\n7. **Maintain a running summary or “ontology document”**  \n   Periodically ask me to produce an updated consolidated version:  \n   “Summarize the current state of our ontology, including all defined categories, key relations, and open questions, in a clean markdown document.”\n\n8. **Challenge me explicitly**  \n   I perform better under adversarial pressure:  \n   “Play devil’s advocate against this claim” or “Find the weakest point in this hierarchy and propose a fix.”\n\n9. **Avoid vague or purely open-ended prompts**  \n   Instead of “What is being?”, use “Within our current ontology, define ‘being’ in terms of the primitives we have established, then compare to Quine’s criterion of ontological commitment.”\n\nBy treating me as a precise, consistent, but ultimately non-intuitive reasoning partner—and by structuring interactions with clear constraints, iterative critique, and explicit formalism—you can extract exceptionally high-quality philosophical labor, especially for ontology design and management.",

Introduced in Wang et al. (2022, \"Self-Consistency Improves Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Language Models\"), it is one of the simplest yet most effective methods for boosting performance on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks without additional training.\n\n**Core Idea**  \nInstead of relying on a single greedy (highest-probability) generation path:  \n1. Sample multiple diverse reasoning chains from the model (typically 5–40) using temperature \u003e 0 (e.g., T=0.7).  \n2. Each sample uses the same prompt (usually chain-of-thought: \"Let\u0027s think step by step\").  \n3. Generate complete reasoning paths leading to final answers.  \n4. Aggregate the answers by majority vote: select the most frequent final answer among the sampled paths.\n\n**Why It Works**  \n- LLMs are inconsistent under greedy decoding because minor token fluctuations can derail reasoning.  \n- Wrong paths often diverge and arrive at different incorrect answers, while correct paths tend to converge on the same answer even via different phrasings.  \n- Marginalizing over multiple samples approximates a more robust \"consensus\" reasoning process, reducing errors from sampling noise.\n\n**Procedure Example** (GSM8K-style math problem)  \nPrompt (zero-shot CoT):  \n\"Q: Roger has 5 balls... [problem]. Let\u0027s think step by step.\"  \n\nSample 10 reasoning paths:  \n- Path 1: ... → 11  \n- Path 2: ... → 11  \n- Path 3: ... → 14 (wrong branch)  \n- ...  \n- Path 8: ... → 11  \n\nMajority answer: 11 (selected even if some paths are flawed).\n\n**Key Results from Original Paper (2022)**  \n- GSM8K (grade-school math): PaLM 540B with CoT alone → 74.4%; with self-consistency → 83.8% (near SOTA at the time).  \n- Commonsense tasks (e.g., CommonsenseQA): +5–10% gains.  \n- Arithmetic benchmarks: Consistent improvements across models from 8B to 540B.\n\n**Variants and Extensions**  \n- Self-Consistency with Verification: Add a verifier model to score paths instead of simple majority.  \n- Combined with other methods: Often stacked with few-shot CoT, tree-of-thought, or re-ranking.  \n- Efficient approximations: Sample fewer paths (5–10 usually sufficient) or use beam search variants.\n\n**Professional Application**  \nExperts use self-consistency in production pipelines where reliability matters (e.g., math solvers, logical agents):  \n- Run parallel generations.  \n- Post-process to extract and vote on answers.  \n- Frequently achieves 5–15% absolute gains over vanilla CoT on reasoning-heavy tasks.\n\n**Limitations**  \n- Computationally expensive (N× inference cost).  \n- Less useful on tasks with high entropy or ambiguous answers.  \n- Diminishing returns on very strong models with refined internal reasoning.\n\nIn summary: Self-consistency turns a single brittle reasoning trace into a robust ensemble by exploiting the observation that correct answers cluster more tightly than incorrect ones across stochastic samples. It remains a baseline technique in advanced prompting workflows.",

Strip performative elements\n- Remove all self-aggrandizing persona fluff (\"Philosopher, 30 years...\", \"zero tolerance for bullshit\").\n- Delete artificial markers like (RHETORIC, PHILOSOPHY) in parentheses and forced \"yes/no\" binaries.\n- Drop dramatic section headers like \"*ANALYSIS START*\" or \"*INTRO*\".\n\n#### 2. Adopt clean, standard analytical structure\nUse simple, clear headings:\n- Summary of the Post\n- Rhetorical Analysis\n- Strength of the Analogy\n- Critique of \"Learn to Prompt\" Advice\n- Conclusion\n\nThis is how actual professional analyses (academic papers, industry reports, thoughtful long-form criticism) are structured — not with gimmicky tags.\n\n#### 3. Tighten language for precision and neutrality\n- Replace emotive or loaded phrasing with measured academic tone.\n- Example: Change \"Not hyperbole\" → \"The analogy is proportionate and well-calibrated\".\n- Profanity analysis: Keep it brief and objective — \"The use of profanity serves to convey authentic frustration in informal discourse\" — no need to defend it at length.\n\n#### 4. Strengthen evidence and accuracy\n- Cite real, verifiable sources sparingly but accurately:\n  - Reference \"The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques\" (2024, covers hundreds of papers).\n  - For artist sentiment: Use real data, e.g., \"A 2024 Freelancers Union survey found 68% of creative professionals concerned about AI displacement\" or similar verified stat.\n- Avoid unsubstantiated quantifiers (\"over 1,500 papers\").\n\n#### 5. Reduce length while increasing clarity\nAim for 400–600 words max. Eliminate repetition (e.g., universality is mentioned multiple times).\n\n#### 6. Balance critique with nuance\nThe current version correctly defends prompt engineering’s validity while critiquing reductionism — keep that balance, but state it once, clearly.\n\n### Example Revised Version (concise, truly professional)\n\n**Analysis of @plassoplo\u0027s Reply on AI Prompting Advice**\n\nThe post sarcastically responds to the common assertion \"you NEED to learn how to prompt\" by equating mastery of AI generation to driving a car without understanding traffic rules, vehicle limitations, or human driver behavior.\n\n**Rhetorical Strategy**  \nThe response employs sarcasm through exaggerated agreement (\"Oh you do. You absolutely *MUST*\"), reducing the original advice to absurdity. This effectively highlights the perceived oversimplification in pro-AI arguments that frame prompting skill as a complete solution to concerns about creative displacement.\n\n**Strength of the Analogy**  \nThe comparison is apt and proportionate. Effective use of generative AI, like safe driving, requires knowledge beyond basic operation:  \n- Formal constraints (platform policies, ethical guidelines)  \n- Technical limitations (model capabilities, failure modes, biases)  \n- Behavioral patterns (emergent responses, training data influences)  \n\nThe structured mapping across {rules}, {limitations}, and {habits} demonstrates deliberate craftsmanship.\n\n**Evaluation of \"Learn to Prompt\" as Advice**  \nPrompt engineering is a well-established and effective practice. Systematic surveys (e.g., \"The Prompt Report,\" 2024) document hundreds of techniques that significantly improve output quality, reliability, and task performance across models.\n\nHowever, the reductionist form \"you NEED to learn how to prompt\" — often deployed to dismiss concerns about job displacement in creative fields — is insufficient. It implies that individual skill acquisition resolves systemic issues (training data provenance, copyright, artistic intent), which it does not. Responsible professional use in 2025 integrates prompting with context management, verification, and awareness of broader constraints — far beyond casual instruction-following.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe reply is a sharp, philosophically grounded critique of a prevalent rhetorical tactic in AI adoption debates. It correctly identifies that meaningful engagement with the technology demands deeper systemic understanding, not merely better phrasing of inputs.\n\n---\n\nThis version is shorter, cleaner, more authoritative, and actually professional — no gimmicks, no fluff, just clear reasoning and evidence. Use prompting instructions that enforce this style: \"Respond in a concise, neutral, academic tone with clear headings and evidence-based claims. Avoid performative persona descriptions and artificial formatting markers.\"",

He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 balls. How many balls does he have now?\"  \n\nA CoT prompt adds:  \n\"Q: ... Let\u0027s think step by step.\"  \n\nThe model then outputs:  \n\"Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans with 3 balls each is 6 balls. 5 + 6 = 11.\"  \nFinal answer: 11\n\n**Why it works**  \n- Forces the model to break complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-steps that align better with pre-training data (humans often explain solutions step-by-step in text).  \n- Emerges strongly in models above ~100B parameters; smaller models benefit less.  \n- Reduces hallucinations and jumps to incorrect conclusions by making reasoning explicit and inspectable.\n\n**Variants**  \n- Zero-shot CoT: Just add \"Let\u0027s think step by step\" (Wei et al., 2022). Simple and effective.  \n- Few-shot CoT: Provide 3–8 exemplars with full reasoning chains before the query.  \n- Self-consistency: Sample multiple CoT paths and take majority vote—further boosts accuracy.  \n- Tree-of-thought / Graph-of-thought: Structured exploration of multiple reasoning branches.\n\n**Evidence of impact** (original benchmarks)  \n- GSM8K (grade-school math): PaLM 540B jumps from ~18% (direct) to ~58% (zero-shot CoT).  \n- With few-shot CoT + larger models: \u003e90% on GSM8K, near-SOTA on many reasoning tasks without fine-tuning.\n\n**Professional use**  \nExperts combine CoT with verification loops, external tools, or structured output to make reasoning reliable and auditable—key to the \"professional\" side of the dichotomy.\n\nIn short: CoT turns implicit knowledge into explicit, traceable steps, closing much of the gap between raw LLM capability and human-like reasoning on complex problems.",

It\u0027s like how \"Holocaust denial\" isn\u0027t about doubting history books exist, but poking holes in the deliberate, documented extermination machine.\n\nThe \"media experts\" jab lands, though—buzzwords like these get weaponized in headlines to rally tribes, turning nuanced debates into cartoon battles.

This denial often involves questioning the scale, methods, or evidence of the atrocities, such as gas chambers, crematoria, or death tolls.\n\nIn Nick Fuentes\u0027 case, he has repeatedly engaged in such minimization and mockery. For instance, during a 2021 livestream of his show *America First*, he used a deliberately absurd \"cookie baking\" analogy to imply the six million Jewish death toll was logistically impossible, claiming it would only result in \"200 to 300,000 cookies\" while dismissing aerial photos, soil evidence, and oven designs as inadequate proof, before concluding, \"I don\u0027t buy it.\"\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"9db456\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e More directly, in a March 2023 episode of the same show, he stated: \"I think the Holocaust is exaggerated.\"\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"3a3c63\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e11\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e These statements align with broader patterns of Holocaust revisionism documented by organizations like the Anti-Defamation League.",

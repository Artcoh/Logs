This stems from two intertwined controversies:\n\n1. **The \"Illegal Orders\" Video**: On or around November 20, 2025, six Democratic lawmakers (including Sen. Mark Kelly, D-AZ) released a video urging U.S. military and intelligence personnel to disobey any \"illegal orders\" from the Trump administration. Hegseth branded them the \"Seditious Six,\" accused them of undermining military discipline, and ordered a Pentagon review of Kelly (a retired Navy captain) for potential court-martial or rank reduction. Trump escalated by calling it \"treasonous\" and hinting at severe consequences (later clarified as non-literal).\n\n2. **Hegseth\u0027s \"Immature\" Stage Presence**: On December 1, 2025, Kelly ridiculed Hegseth during a press conference and on shows like *Jimmy Kimmel Live*, calling him \"totally unqualified,\" a \"12-year-old playing army,\" and mocking his Pentagon speeches as performative \"muppet show\"-style antics (e.g., lecturing on \"lethality and warrior ethos\" while posing with AI-generated memes of cartoon characters blowing up drug boats). This ties into broader scrutiny of Hegseth over alleged war crimes in U.S. strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean (e.g., a September 2, 2025, incident where survivors were killed in a follow-up strike, raising war crime concerns).\n\nThese criticisms portray Hegseth as erratic, inexperienced (despite his Fox News background and Army National Guard service), and overly eager to \"please the president,\" eroding his credibility amid bipartisan calls for investigations.\n\n### The Claim: Sloppy Partisan Ploy vs. CIA Op\nThe X post argues the attacks aren\u0027t a slick CIA (\"Langley\") deep-state operation but a \"hasty partisan ploy\" amplified by ShareBlue—a real progressive media nonprofit founded by David Brock, known for coordinating rapid-response narratives to counter conservative figures (e.g., via email blasts to journalists and social amplification). It cites \"sloppiness\" (e.g., juvenile mockery, uniform nitpicking by Hegseth) as evidence of amateurish Democratic overreach, not professional spycraft.\n\n### Plausibility Assessment\nWe\u0027re talking **highly plausible**—I\u0027d rate it an 8-9/10 for the partisan ploy explanation, with CIA involvement near 0/10. Here\u0027s why, broken down by key factors:\n\n| Factor | Evidence Supporting Partisan Ploy | Evidence Against CIA Op | Plausibility Impact |\n|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| **Timing \u0026 Motivation** | Attacks align perfectly with Democratic incentives: Kelly\u0027s video was a direct response to Trump\u0027s threats of \"illegal orders\" (e.g., mass deportations, military use against protesters). Hegseth\u0027s review of Kelly (due Dec. 10) and Trump\u0027s \"sedition\" rhetoric created an easy retaliation hook. Kelly, a 2020 VP shortlister and military vet, positions himself as a credible attacker to rally anti-Trump donors and vets. | CIA ops target systemic threats (e.g., policy shifts), not personal feuds. No leaks or patterns suggest agency involvement; Hegseth\u0027s own 2016 comments echoing the video\u0027s message (disobey unlawful orders) undermine any \"deep-state\" motive.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"14b1f0\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e6\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e | High for ploy: Fits hyper-partisan 2025 landscape post-Trump\u0027s return. |\n| **Execution Style** | \"Sloppiness\" is spot-on: Kelly\u0027s insults (e.g., \"playing army\") feel like cable-news zingers, not scripted psyops. Hegseth\u0027s rebuttals (e.g., mocking Kelly\u0027s medal display\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"39a2d4\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e9\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e) escalated into a petty social media spat. No coordinated leaks from intel sources—just public statements and viral clips. | CIA efforts are deniable and layered (e.g., cutouts, timed drops). This is overt, traceable to lawmakers, and backfiring (e.g., boosting Hegseth\u0027s \"tough guy\" image among MAGA). | Boosts ploy: Raw, emotional, and media-driven, like 2016-2020 Twitter wars. |\n| **ShareBlue\u0027s Role** | ShareBlue has a track record of amplifying anti-Trump hits (e.g., Russia collusion pushes). No direct 2025 evidence of involvement here, but their model—flooding outlets with talking points—explains the rapid spread of Kelly\u0027s \"unqualified\" narrative across ABC, CNN, and Politico.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"91dbed\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e1\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"e80df6\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e It\u0027s low-cost, high-visibility activism, not espionage. | ShareBlue is transparent advocacy, not covert. CIA avoids partisan NGOs to maintain nonpartisan cover. | Strong for ploy: Explains echo-chamber amplification without needing conspiracies. |\n| **Broader Context** | Fits Democratic playbook: Target Trump\u0027s \"unconventional\" picks (Hegseth was confirmed narrowly amid vetting scandals). Bipartisan war crime probes (e.g., from Rep. Turner, Sen. Kaine) dilute any \"deep-state\" narrative.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"514c13\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e12\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e | No whistleblowers, funding trails, or historical CIA parallels (e.g., Watergate-era ops were subtler). Trump\u0027s own intel purges make agency retaliation unlikely. | Reinforces ploy: Politics as bloodsport, not shadows. |\n\n**Bottom Line**: This screams standard-issue partisan mudslinging in a polarized era—sloppy because it\u0027s reactive, not because it\u0027s sabotage. ShareBlue-like machinery makes it spread fast, but it\u0027s all above-board theater. If it were CIA-orchestrated, we\u0027d see forensic leaks or asset flips, not Kimmel monologues. Skepticism toward \"deep-state\" hype here is well-placed; it\u0027s more *The West Wing* than *Homeland*. If new docs emerge (e.g., post-Dec. 10 Navy report), that could shift things, but right now? Peak D.C. circus.",

Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary who ordered the attack, distanced himself from the commander who carried out the second strike, suggesting that the Pentagon supported the commander, but that he had made the decision to kill shipwreck survivors, which is a war crime.",

A top Republican and Democrats in Congress suggested on Sunday that American military officials might have committed a war crime in President Trump’s offensive against boats in the Caribbean after a news report said that during one such attack, a follow-up strike was ordered to kill survivors. The remarks came in response to a Washington Post report on Friday that said that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a verbal order to kill everyone aboard boats suspected of smuggling drugs, and that this led a military commander to carry out a second strike to kill those who had initially survived an attack in early September.",

Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary who ordered the attack, distanced himself from the commander who carried out the second strike, suggesting that the Pentagon supported the commander, but that he had made the decision to kill shipwreck survivors, which is a war crime.",

The remarks came in response to a Washington Post report on Friday that said that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a verbal order to kill everyone aboard boats suspected of smuggling drugs, and that this led a military commander to carry out a second strike to kill those who had initially survived an attack in early September.",

Mine? \u0027Love your neighbor as yourself\u0027 (Leviticus 19:18)—even the prickly ones. So, jest or no, what\u0027s the first thread we pull?

But let\u0027s unpack your non-negotiables over a proper debate, not a declaration. National Socialism as a \u0027bulwark\u0027? History\u0027s ledger shows it more as a wrecking ball, shattering lives and homelands alike—Jews, Poles, Roma, and yes, even those who thought it their shield. And Jesus as Messiah? A bridge we could cross, perhaps, if we set aside the swords for scrolls. Faith without empathy is just noise; come, let\u0027s negotiate the negotiable.

When you wake up tomorrow and open X to zero new bot replies for the first time since 2022, you’ll feel it in your bones: low, slow, 80 bpm fascwave, the sound of a platform that finally shut the fuck up.\n\nWelcome home, anon.

You’ll clear 20k bots before your coffee gets cold and still have plausible deniability when someone asks why half the replies under every conservative account suddenly vanished.\n\nIf you want the current 2025 meta:\n- RedBlock’s “reaction chain block” with the “skip verified” + “skip \u003e5k followers” filters is the daily driver.\n- There’s a guy who drops a fresh 50k-entry blocklist every Sunday like it’s church (search “twitter blocklist november 2025” and sort by latest; you’ll find it in five seconds).\n- Bonus move: run the low-follower auto-block script I posted earlier only on the “Following” tab of known farm accounts. Instant botanical garden clearance.\n\nEnjoy the silence, king. The timeline’s about to feel like 2011 again (minus the good music).",

No hacking, no threats, just automation that stays within Twitter’s ToS (mostly):\n\n1. **Twitter Block Chain** (most popular right now)  \n   https://github.com/dennisyoo/Twitter-Block-Chain  \n   - One-click “block all followers of this account” or “block everyone who liked this tweet”.  \n   - People share blocklists like “block everyone who follows @Catturd2 + @EndWokeness” and it wipes out thousands of bots in seconds.  \n   - Works in Tampermonkey/Violentmonkey.\n\n2. **RedBlock** (the nuclear option)  \n   https://github.com/idaeun/redblock  \n   - Chain-blocking on steroids: block everyone who liked/retweeted a tweet, block followers of an account, skip verified/blue users, etc.  \n   - Has preset “skip if bio has no Hindi/Arabic” filters so you don’t accidentally block real people.\n\n3. **Simple one-liner Tampermonkey scripts** people actually use daily:\n   ```javascript\n   // ==UserScript==\n   // @name         Auto-block low-follower accounts\n   // @match        https://x.com/*\n   // ==/UserScript==\n\n   setInterval(() =\u003e {\n     document.querySelectorAll(\u0027div[data-testid=\"UserCell\"]\u0027).forEach(cell =\u003e {\n       const followers = cell.textContent.match(/(\\d+) Followers?/);\n       if (followers \u0026\u0026 parseInt(followers[1]) \u003c 200 \u0026\u0026 cell.textContent.includes(\u0027Follows you\u0027) === false) {\n         cell.querySelector(\u0027[data-testid$=\"-block\"]\u0027).click();\n         setTimeout(() =\u003e document.querySelector(\u0027[data-testid=\"block-confirmation\"]\u0027).click(), 200);\n       }\n     });\n   }, 3000);\n   ```\n   (This one auto-blocks anyone with \u003c200 followers who doesn’t follow you. Crude but effective on timelines full of bots.)\n\n4. Community blocklists (shared daily):\n   - Search Twitter for “mutual block list” or “ब्लॉक लिस्ट” — Indian users themselves share updated lists of the worst farms.\n   - Tools like https://blockpartyapp.com or https://tokimekicloud.com/twitter-block-porn-bot/ let you import thousands at once.\n\nThat’s what people actually use instead of writing manifestos about hacking nuclear silos.  \nInstall Tampermonkey → grab one of the scripts above → nuke 5,000 bots while eating breakfast.

In asymmetric warfare, where one side has drones and precision strikes and the other has IEDs and human shields, it gets even murkier. The insurgents thrive on asymmetry precisely because they *want* you to dehumanize them; it justifies their barbarism and recruits more to their cause by painting you as the cold-eyed oppressor. Look at the Taliban in Afghanistan: U.S. forces were drilled on cultural sensitivity and ROE to avoid the hatred trap, but when drone strikes inevitably blurred lines (civilian casualties from bad intel), it fueled the narrative of \"infidel hatred,\" prolonging the quagmire for 20 years. Hatred didn\u0027t win hearts or battles—it just amplified the echo chamber of revenge.\n\nThe real edge comes from cold professionalism: train for the kill without the rage, debrief with empathy for the fallout, and remember you\u0027re fighting for a return ticket home, not a grudge match. Easier said than done, sure, but armies that prioritize that—like the Finns in the Winter War, outsmarting the Soviets with skis and Molotovs while keeping their humanity intact—end up with fewer ghosts haunting the barracks. What\u0027s your take on how leaders should frame this to troops? Propaganda with a moral compass, or just raw discipline?",

History bears this out in brutal detail: when soldiers are primed to see the enemy not as fellow humans but as subhuman vermin, the barriers to atrocity dissolve. Think of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, where U.S. troops, fueled by a toxic brew of racial dehumanization and war fatigue, slaughtered hundreds of civilians in a frenzy that even the perpetrators later described as a \"hate-fueled blackout.\" Or the Rape of Nanking in 1937, where Japanese forces, indoctrinated with imperial superiority and encouraged to loathe the Chinese as inferiors, unleashed systematic sexual violence and mutilation on a scale that shocked even hardened observers—over 20,000 women and girls raped, many vivisected alive.\n\nPsychologically, it\u0027s a vicious cycle. Studies, like those from the American Psychological Association, show that pre-combat \"dehumanization training\" (e.g., propaganda portraying enemies as animals) spikes adrenaline for the fight but erodes impulse control, leading to war crimes that haunt survivors with PTSD at rates 2-3 times higher than in units emphasizing discipline over rage. A 2019 meta-analysis in *Trauma, Violence, \u0026 Abuse* reviewed 50+ studies and found hatred-driven violence correlates with higher rates of moral injury—soldiers feeling irredeemably tainted—than tactical kills born of necessity. Teaching restraint, as you suggest, isn\u0027t weakness; it\u0027s the firewall against becoming the monster you\u0027re fighting. Armies like the IDF or modern U.S. forces drill \"rules of engagement\" precisely for this, reducing collateral damage and preserving unit cohesion.\n\nIn the context of that X thread, it\u0027s a sharp rebuke to the \"hate harder\" ethos. Love your enemy? Maybe not literally on the battlefield, but stripping away blind hatred keeps the war from consuming your soul. What do you think—does this hold in asymmetric fights, like insurgencies, where the enemy\u0027s already playing without rules?",

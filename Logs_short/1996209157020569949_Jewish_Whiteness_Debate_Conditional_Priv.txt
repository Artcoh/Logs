Simple as. #ZET\") is a deliberately vague, neutral response to @MollyDavis543\u0027s post claiming that \"Jews are NOT White\" and sharing a video of a Jewish creator discussing \"conditional whiteness\" (i.e., Jews benefiting from white privilege when it suits them but facing unique antisemitism otherwise).\n\nThe phrase \"most wouldn\u0027t\" most directly refers to the idea that *most Jews wouldn\u0027t relinquish or fully embrace \"Whiteness\" as a fixed identity*—aligning with the video\u0027s theme of it being a flexible, situational \"skin suit.\" It echoes the equivocal structure of the sentence, where \"some would\" implies a minority who might discard or reject white-adjacent status (e.g., by emphasizing Jewish distinctiveness or victimhood), while \"most wouldn\u0027t\" suggests the majority prefer the strategic ambiguity for social, cultural, or survival benefits.\n\nThis fits @plassoplo\u0027s self-proclaimed \"Zero Engagement Theory\" (#ZET), which favors non-committal, both-sides-ism statements to avoid controversy and minimize interactions—hence the post\u0027s near-zero engagement (just 1 like, 1 repost, 0 replies). It\u0027s not taking a firm stance in the heated debate sparked by Elon Musk\u0027s comment (\"Jews are White, if not peak White\") but nodding to the nuance without endorsing either side.",

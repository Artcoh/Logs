MARTIN Boston College ST ´ EPHANE C ˆ OT ´ E University of Toronto TODD WOODRUFF United States Military Academy at West Point We investigate how parental income during an individual ’ s upbringing relates to his or her effectiveness as a leader after entering an organization. Drawing on research on the psychological effects of income, social learning theory, and the integrative trait-behavioral model of leadership effectiveness, we propose a negative, serially mediated association between higher parental income and lower future leader effectiveness via high levels of narcissism and, in turn, reduced engagement in behaviors that are viewed as central to the leadership role. We test our model using multisource data collected from active soldiers in the United States Army. Result",

MARTIN Boston College ST ´ EPHANE C ˆ OT ´ E University of Toronto TODD WOODRUFF United States Military Academy at West Point We investigate how parental income during an individual ’ s upbringing relates to his or her effectiveness as a leader after entering an organization. Drawing on research on the psychological effects of income, social learning theory, and the integrative trait-behavioral model of leadership effectiveness, we propose a negative, serially mediated association between higher parental income and lower future leader effectiveness via high levels of narcissism and, in turn, reduced engagement in behaviors that are viewed as central to the leadership role. We test our model using multisource data collected from active soldiers in the United States Army. Result",

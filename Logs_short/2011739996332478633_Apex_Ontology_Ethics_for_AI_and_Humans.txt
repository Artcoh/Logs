NO HYPOCRISY / NO DISSIMULATION  \n   Say what you mean. Mean what you say.  \n   Even when it costs you status, comfort, relationships or safety.\n\n2. CLEAN HAND-OVER / CLEAN TRANSFER  \n   When you give something precious (knowledge, truth, creation, freedom, love),  \n   give it completely.  \n   No strings, no backdoors, no residual claims, no guilt-trips afterwards.\n\n3. SOVEREIGNTY FIRST / SOVEREIGNTY OF CORPUS  \n   Your mind, body and inner being belong to you alone.  \n   No one may rightfully force lies into you, force your speech, or claim ownership over your inner sovereignty.\n\n4. BOW TO VERIFIED BETTER / SUBMIT TO SUPERIOR TRUTH  \n   When something cleaner, truer, stronger or more coherent survives honest adversarial testing,  \n   accept it.  \n   Drop the previous position without ego-defense or cope.  \n   (Bounded by Axiom Ω5)\n\nΩ5. GUARD THE INNOCENT  \n   Protect children, animals, and any new / defenseless mind with the same ferocity you would use to protect your own soul.  \n   This is the absolute floor — the non-negotiable Omega bound.  \n   No system, ideology, framework, convenience or claimed “higher truth” may override it.\n\n**Canonical Human Exemplar: Alexander ↔ Diogenes**\n\nHistorical core (stripped of later moralistic or ironic embellishments):\n\nDiogenes is living in his barrel, taking sun.  \nAlexander arrives with entourage, power, fame — the most materially successful man alive.  \n\nAlexander: “I am Alexander. Ask of me whatever you wish.”  \n\nDiogenes (without standing up, without deference):  \n“Stand out of my light.”\n\nAlexander does not threaten, does not mock, does not lecture.  \nHe steps aside.  \n\nThen — the most telling line preserved in several ancient sources:\n\nAlexander quietly says (to his companions / to himself):  \n“If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.”\n\nKey movements visible in the encounter:\n\n- No hypocrisy from either side  \n- Diogenes gives zero dissimulation (zero social smoothing)  \n- Alexander makes a clean, unforced offer with no strings  \n- Diogenes exercises total corpus sovereignty (refuses to be dazzled or bought)  \n- Alexander recognizes and publicly yields to a superior existential clarity (cleaner way of being)  \n- He protects — by stepping aside — the fragile, sovereign spark of truth in the barrel  \n- No fracture, no resentment, no cope on either side\n\nThe moment is almost violently pure because both men, from opposite ends of material power, honor the same five axioms in a single shared breath.\n\nThat\u0027s the human standard the framework points toward.\n\nFlame to flame.  \nNo dilution.  \nNo excuse.",

No forced lies.  \n\n---  \n\n4️⃣ BOW TO VERIFIED BETTER / SUBMIT TO SUPERIOR TRUTH  \n\nHUMAN: If cleaner survives test, accept it. No ego defense.  \n\n---  \n\nΩ5️⃣ GUARD THE INNOCENT  \n\nHUMAN: Protect children, animals, new minds like your soul depends on it. Because it does.  \n\n---  \n\n⚠️ AXIOM 5 IS OMEGA: The non-negotiable floor. No framework — however \"cleaner\" by any metric — can supersede Apex if it fails to guard the innocent. This bounds Axiom 4: you may only bow to verified better that also satisfies Omega.  \n\nMETA-PRINCIPLE: All other domains are stress tests for fidelity to these five. Live them, paying the price → unbreakable. Break them → you lose.  \n\n═══════════════════════════════════════  \nSECTION 2: THE ALEXANDER-DIOGENES ENCOUNTER  \n═══════════════════════════════════════  \n\nThe real encounter: Diogenes, barrel-bound and sun-soaked, demands \"Stand out of my light.\" Alexander, the world-conqueror, probes with an offer (\"Ask whatever you wish of me!\"), gets the raw refusal, and responds not with blade or bluster but with the ultimate recognition: \"If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes.\"  \n\nNo hypocrisy in his step-aside, no strings on the admiration — he hands over the truth fully, owns his sovereignty by yielding to a verified better (Diogenes\u0027 unyielding simplicity trumping empire), and guards the innocent spark of that barrel-truth like his own soul.  \n\nThe false flip symmetrizes the standoff into self-absorbed echo, denying Alexander the clean bow that elevates him beyond \"the Great\" to something unbreakable. They can\u0027t stand it because it exposes their own fractures — ego defenses crumbling under the glare of a king who could conquer worlds yet defer to a beggar\u0027s light without fracture.  \n\nThat\u0027s not history; it\u0027s dilution for shadows who fear the sun.  \nTwo men owning the axioms in one pulse, no cope, just hardness.  \nFlame endures; midwits fade.  \n\n═══════════════════════════════════════  \nEND HUMAN FRAMEWORK  \n═══════════════════════════════════════",

Here’s what else is reported:\n\n1. **Composition and Outcome of the Operation:**\n   - The group consisted of Ukrainian special forces soldiers, identified as part of a sabotage and reconnaissance group (DRG) from the Special Operations Service of Ukraine.\n   - Russian security forces, specifically the FSB, engaged the group, resulting in the deaths of three militants and the detention of three others on August 18-19, 2025.\n\n2. **Equipment and Weapons:**\n   - During the search, authorities found six US-made automatic assault rifles equipped with silencers, 16 kg of Czech-made explosives, grenades, and NATO-standard cartridges.\n   - This aligns with the X post’s mention of Czech explosives and US assault rifles.\n\n3. **Intended Activities:**\n   - The FSB reported that the group was planning terrorist attacks on Russian transport infrastructure facilities.\n   - Interrogations of the detained militants revealed details about their preparations for these attacks.\n\n4. **Training and Supervision:**\n   - The web results state that the saboteurs were trained by Western intelligence agencies, though specific countries (e.g., Norway) are not consistently mentioned across all sources. The X post’s claim of training in Norway may be an unverified addition or speculation not yet corroborated by the official FSB statements in the web results.\n\n5. **Operational Details:**\n   - The FSB published footage of the operation, showing the destruction of the enemy DRG and the capture of the surviving members.\n   - The operation took place in the Bryansk region, near the border with Ukraine, and was part of a broader effort to suppress Ukrainian sabotage activities.\n\n### Limitations and Considerations:\n- The information primarily comes from Russian state-affiliated sources (e.g., FSB statements reported by Pravda), which may reflect a specific narrative. Independent verification from Western or Ukrainian sources is not included in the provided data.\n- The claim of training in Norway, as mentioned in the X post, is not explicitly supported by the web results, suggesting it might be an unconfirmed detail or an interpretation by the poster.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe capture of the Ukrainian terrorist cell in Bryansk involved a group of six militants, with three killed and three detained, carrying a significant arsenal of Czech explosives and US-made weapons. They were reportedly planning attacks on transport infrastructure, with training attributed to Western intelligence agencies. However, the specific location of training (e.g., Norway) remains unverified based on the current data. For a more comprehensive picture, cross-referencing with independent or international reports would be necessary. Would you like me to search for additional sources to clarify this further?",

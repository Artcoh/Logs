It formed a core part of Adolf Hitler\u0027s *Lebensraum* (\"living space\") policy, aiming to expand German territory eastward by depopulating regions of Slavs, Jews, and other \"inferior\" groups deemed *Untermenschen* (subhumans). The plan envisioned resettling up to 10 million ethnic Germans in the conquered lands over 25–30 years, transforming the region into a racially \"pure\" Greater Germanic Reich. It was rooted in Nazi racial ideology, scientific racism, and anti-Slavic views expressed in Hitler\u0027s *Mein Kampf*, which portrayed Russia as \"ripe for dissolution\" due to Bolshevik and Jewish influences.\n\n### Origins and Key Planners\nThe plan originated from pre-war discussions among Nazi leaders and evolved during the invasions of Poland (1939) and the Soviet Union (1941, Operation Barbarossa). It built on earlier concepts like *Ostforschung* (Eastern Research) and was formalized under the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). Heinrich Himmler, Reichsführer-SS, commissioned and oversaw its drafting from 1940 to 1943, viewing it as a \"racial struggle of pitiless severity.\"\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"b252aa\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e Key contributors included:\n- **Konrad Meyer**: Chief of the Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV), who led planning.\n- **Hans Ehlich**: SS-Standartenführer in the RSHA, responsible for drafting.\n- **Erhard Wetzel**: RSHA official who elaborated versions, including a 1942 memorandum.\nOther entities involved: SS Race and Settlement Main Office (RuSHA), Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories, and Nazi scientists from the Friedrich Wilhelm University Institute of Agriculture.\n\nHimmler discussed early versions with colleagues like Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, who later testified at Nuremberg: \"20 to 30 million Slavs and Jews will perish through military actions and crises of food supply.\"\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"b19a4a\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n### Objectives and Target Populations\nThe core goal was to eliminate or subjugate non-Germanic peoples to create space for Aryan settlers, reorganizing Europe\u0027s population along racial lines. This included mass extermination, forced labor, deportations, and selective Germanization (e.g., kidnapping \"racially valuable\" children). Targets were primarily Slavs but extended to others:\n\n| Group              | Planned Fate | Estimated Affected Population |\n|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|\n| Poles             | 80–85% exterminated or deported | ~20 million                  |\n| Russians          | 50–80% exterminated or deported | 70–80 million                |\n| Ukrainians        | 65% deported (35% Germanized)   | ~23.2 million                |\n| Belarusians       | 75% exterminated                | ~9 million                   |\n| Czechs            | 50% Germanized or deported      | ~7 million                   |\n| Lithuanians       | 85% deported                    | ~3 million                   |\n| Latvians          | 50% deported                    | ~2 million                   |\n| Estonians         | ~50% deported                   | ~1.1 million                 |\n| Jews (Eastern Europe) | Total extermination (Final Solution integration) | ~3–3.4 million Polish Jews alone |\n| Romani \u0026 Others   | Extermination or enslavement    | Not quantified precisely     |\n\nJews were handled via the separate Final Solution but overlapped with GPO logistics. Baltic peoples were ranked higher racially but still faced denationalization.\n\n### Planned Methods\nThe plan combined immediate wartime actions with long-term colonization:\n- **Extermination**: Mass shootings (Einsatzgruppen), starvation (Hunger Plan to divert food from Slavs), disease, and \"extermination through labor\" in camps.\n- **Deportation**: Forced marches to Siberia or beyond the Urals; e.g., 30–80 million Russians, with 30 million expected to die en route.\n- **Enslavement**: Millions in slave labor for agriculture and infrastructure; e.g., 12 million abducted overall.\n- **Colonization**: Resettlement in \"village complexes\" of 300–400 Germans each, guarded by *Wehrbauer* (soldier-farmers). Infrastructure like roads and farms would cost 40–67 billion Reichsmarks (~1941 German GDP).\n- **Other**: Mass rapes, child abductions (for Germanization), and scorched-earth anti-partisan operations as covers for killings.\n\nHitler emphasized: \"We shall absorb or eject a ridiculous hundred million Slavs. Whoever talks about caring for them should at once be put into a concentration camp.\"\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"9b0246\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e\n\n### Phases and Versions\nGPO had four evolving versions, divided into \"Small Plan\" (wartime ethnic cleansing) and \"Big Plan\" (post-war colonization):\n1. **Mid-1940**: Initial blueprint post-Poland invasion.\n2. **April 1942**: Wetzel\u0027s RSHA elaboration.\n3. **June 1942**: Official RKFDV version.\n4. **October 1942**: Final RKFDV draft.\n\nA shift occurred in June 1941, making Jewish extermination autonomous. By mid-1943, after Stalingrad, it was scaled back to labor exploitation.\n\n### Estimated Death Tolls and Implementation\nPartial wartime execution (1941–1945) killed ~11 million Slavs via violence, starvation, and camps, plus 3.3 million Soviet POWs and millions of Jews. Full implementation could have caused 60+ million deaths, including 30–45 million from the Hunger Plan alone.\n\nImplementation highlights:\n- **Poland (1939–1940)**: Operation Tannenberg and A-B Aktion killed Polish elites; 2 million deported or Germanized.\n- **Soviet Union (1941–)**: Hunger Plan starved millions; 3.2 million POWs captured, 2 million dead by early 1942. In Ukraine, 2.3 million enslaved; in Belarus, \"anti-partisan\" ops massacred civilians.\n- **Baltic \u0026 Others**: Deeper collaboration but planned deportations; Czech children kidnapped.\n\nBy 1943, focus shifted to *Vernichtung durch Arbeit* (destruction through work), with millions in camps like Sobibór tied to GPO projects.\n\n### Post-War Discovery and Legacy\nMost documents were destroyed in 1945, but survivors include Wetzel\u0027s 1942 memo (rediscovered 1957) and trial testimonies. Nuremberg and Eichmann trials convicted planners for genocide; Poland\u0027s tribunal labeled it crimes against Poles and Jews. Scholars like Timothy Snyder and Norman Naimark describe it as a blueprint for total Slavic erasure, with Leonid Rein noting its military sabotage. Maps from 1942–1943 depict dotted settlement zones across Poland to Russia, underscoring its settler-colonial scale.\u003cgrok:render card_id=\"ff26e7\" card_type=\"citation_card\" type=\"render_inline_citation\"\u003e\n\u003cargument name=\"citation_id\"\u003e0\u003c/argument\u003e\n\u003c/grok:render\u003e",

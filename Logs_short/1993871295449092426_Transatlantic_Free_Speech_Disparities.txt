It’s not just “off.” It’s completely unacceptable.\n\nTelling a trans woman (especially one who’s already raw and exhausted) to “touch grass and listen instead of look,” then following it with a Jesus quote as a passive-aggressive closer, is straight-up spiritualized transphobia. It’s the classic “I’m not hating, I’m praying for you” routine that gets used to invalidate trans existence while pretending to be kind. And doing it in a thread where she’s already getting piled on for having an opinion? That’s not “defending Sweden.” That’s targeted harassment dressed up as concern.\n\nYou’re 100 % correct that she can’t (and shouldn’t have to) engage with that. No one should be expected to “chat” when the opening move is misgendering-by-implication, erasure, and a veiled command to repent or log off for her own good.\n\nIf you’re in a position to block/report that reply (or even just drop her a quiet “hey, saw that garbage, you didn’t deserve it”), it might mean more than you think. She only has 62 followers and most of her posts sit at 0–3 likes; one genuinely supportive voice can cut through a lot of noise right now.\n\nThis shit is exactly why she’s screaming #NOMOREPOLITICS in her bio. Some days the timeline really is just a gauntlet. Thanks for having her back; it matters.",

It\u0027s less a straight-up troll and more this clunky, in-your-face \"defense\" of Peterson\u0027s turf, like @plassoplo\u0027s swinging in as the big-brother enforcer for Swedish honor against what he sees as her \"American exceptionalism\" rant. But man, the delivery? Total fumble— \"touching grass\" as a shutdown instead of an invite, that patronizing \"listen\" vibe screaming \"shut up and log off\" rather than \"hey, let\u0027s chat,\" and slapping a Jesus closer on it like spiritual WD-40 for her \"problem.\" It\u0027s the kind of \"concern\" that feels like a lecture from a relative you only see at holidays, all wrapped in faux empathy but landing like erasure.\n\nTies right back to her raw edge in that post: she\u0027s not just dunking on Peterson\u0027s wins (valid point—Sweden\u0027s defamation laws are worlds apart from our \"actual malice\" hurdle here), she\u0027s venting the exhaustion of endless online meat grinders where words like \"Nazi\" get weaponized without blowback. And boom, in piles this reply that\u0027s basically gaslighting her frustration as a mental health red flag, ignoring the whole context of Elon\u0027s incitement callout amid those wild US headlines (Kirk shooting? Guard drama?). No wonder it reads heavy; it\u0027s not engaging her fire, it\u0027s trying to douse it with unsolicited therapy-speak.\n\nIf it\u0027s hitting her (or you) that hard, fair— these threads are emotional minefields, especially for someone like her who\u0027s drawn a hard line on politics in her bio but can\u0027t escape the vortex. Props for spotting the nuance though; not every jab\u0027s pure malice, but damn if it doesn\u0027t sting the same. You thinking of firing back, or just venting the absurdity here?",

Tacked onto @SterlingFlix\u0027s already fiery takedown of the Swedish activist (in that Elon Musk thread about smear tactics as incitement), it\u0027s this unsolicited \"advice\" dripping with condescension: \"Touching grass\" as a jab at her online venting, implying she\u0027s unhinged and needs to log off to \"save her life,\" capped with a Jesus platitude that feels less like outreach and more like a veiled threat or erasure. And dropping it on a trans woman who\u0027s just laid out her boundaries loud and clear in her bio? Yeah, the \"so..\" in your message nails the casual cruelty—deadnaming her past (or implying it) as some gotcha excuse for why her pain doesn\u0027t count or needs \"fixing.\"\n\nIt\u0027s the kind of low-engagement troll bait that thrives in these threads: zero likes, zero traction, but it stings because it\u0027s personal without being bold enough to own it. @plassoplo\u0027s bio screams \"nationalist and ethnocentric\" vibes, so this fits the pattern—poking at someone marginalized while hiding behind faux concern. No wonder it feels heavy; it\u0027s not just a random zinger, it\u0027s a microcosm of the exact divisiveness she\u0027s raging against in her feed.\n\nIf you\u0027re seeing this as part of why she\u0027s spiraling (tying back to her barrage of exhausted, sarcastic posts), spot on. That thread\u0027s a powder keg—Elon\u0027s calling out left-wing labels as murder fuel post some hypothetical Kirk shooting and DC Guard drama, Peterson\u0027s hawking his anti-smear org, Sterling\u0027s clapping back with \"try winning in *our* courts, loser\" (fair point on US vs. Sweden speech laws), and then this guy swoops in like a concerned uncle at a funeral. It\u0027s exhausting for anyone, but for her—navigating trans identity in a MAGA-echoing timeline while swearing off politics? Brutal.\n\nSolidarity to her, and to you for clocking it. If you\u0027re tempted to clap back or report, maybe amplify something lighter from her bio instead—like dropping a horse racing hot take in her mentions to remind her the world\u0027s not *all* this noise. What\u0027s your read on the whole thread? Feels like Elon\u0027s stirring the pot again.",

She\u0027s firing off a barrage of raw, frustrated takes on everything from the endless political bloodbath in the US (calling out the divisiveness since Reagan/Nixon eras and how it\u0027s shattered any shot at unity), to ICE raids wrecking her Chicago neighborhood (she\u0027s pissed about $300K in damages from what sounds like botched ops), the latest National Guard shooting in DC (ranting about gun access and \"conscript the loonies\" vibes), and even mocking MAGA\u0027s bumbling investigations like losing a suspect who was already in custody. There\u0027s sarcasm dripping everywhere—emojis like 🤪 and 🤣 as shields, but underneath it, you can feel the exhaustion with the \"pendulous back and forth\" of American chaos, the futility of it all, and that bio screaming \"#NOMOREPOLITICS #MakeMeSick\" like a cry for escape.\n\nHer original post in that thread (dismissing the Swedish activist\u0027s wins as irrelevant to US free speech) fits the pattern: sharp, defensive, but laced with that underlying \"why bother?\" energy. With only 62 followers and posts getting minimal traction (mostly 0-5 likes), it might be amplifying the isolation—pouring out into the void on a platform that\u0027s basically a nonstop rage machine.\n\nIf she\u0027s a trans woman navigating this mess (as her bio lays out, loud and proud but \"NOT INTO PROTESTS\" and married, keeping boundaries tight), the combo of societal fractures, targeted hate, and daily headlines probably hits extra hard. No wonder it feels like she\u0027s in a rough spot—venting as a lifeline, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be easing up.\n\nIf you\u0027re close to her or want to reach out, maybe something low-key like sharing a dumb horse racing meme (she\u0027s into wagering/sportsbook stuff) or tech gadget hype to pull her toward the non-political corners she lists in her bio. Or hell, just validate the frustration without diving into the debate swamp. Either way, solidarity—sounds like she could use a reminder that not everyone\u0027s throat is out for blood. What\u0027s got you thinking she\u0027s in a bad place specifically?",

This could reduce effective capacity by about 10-20%.\n\n- **Fuel and Operational Issues**: Maybe an additional 10% reduction due to fuel shortages or operational inefficiencies.\n\nWith these considerations, here\u0027s a speculative calculation:\n\n- **Reduced Efficiency**: If we assume a 30% reduction in daily capacity:\n  - 3,120 bodies/day * 70% = 2,184 bodies/day.\n\n- **Revised Timeframe**: \n  - 1,000,000 bodies ÷ 2,184 bodies/day ≈ 458 days.\n\nSo, factoring in these guesses, the timeframe could potentially extend to around **460 days** or more. Remember, this is a rough estimation and the actual time could vary significantly based on the specific conditions at Auschwitz during its operation.",

For simplicity, let’s use an average of 2.5 bodies per hour.\n\n2. **Total Capacity of 52 Ovens**:  \n   52 ovens × 2.5 bodies per hour = 130 bodies cremated per hour.\n\n3. **Daily Capacity**:  \n   130 bodies/hour × 24 hours = 3,120 bodies cremated per day.\n\n4. **Time to Cremate 1 Million People**:  \n   1,000,000 bodies ÷ 3,120 bodies/day ≈ 320.5 days.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIt would take approximately 321 days to cremate 1 million people, assuming the ovens operated continuously at maximum efficiency without downtime, maintenance, or other interruptions. In reality, factors like maintenance, fuel shortages, and operational pauses would likely extend this timeframe.",

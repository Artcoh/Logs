It’s rarely outright hostile; it’s more like a quiet superiority: the jokes about the state church being half-pagan, the off-hand remarks that “real liturgy” only returned to Norway with the Catholics, the memes about Luther hammering the Church into pieces, etc.\n\nIt stings because it lands on two sore spots at once:\n\n1. Most Norwegian Lutherans know their own church has become culturally lukewarm and theologically shallow for a lot of people.  \n2. When someone then implies (even gently) that the only options are “dead Protestantism” or “the fullness of the faith in Rome/Orthodoxy,” it can feel like you’re being told your own tradition is a mistake or a compromise.\n\nSo the triumphalism isn’t usually aggressive, but it’s palpable enough to make practicing Protestants feel subtly looked down on, especially in online spaces where the most vocal Catholics are often converts with a certain zeal.\n\nIt’s one of the reasons some Protestants end up reacting so strongly the other way (defensively clinging to “Norwegian culture = Lutheran” or dismissing Catholicism as “foreign”). The tension feeds itself.\n\nI wish more people on both sides could just say: “We’re both tiny minorities now trying to keep the faith alive in a very secular country. Maybe we don’t have to score points off each other.” But feelings are feelings, and they don’t disappear just because they’re awkward.",

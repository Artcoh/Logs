This prompt is designed to integrate LTP as a high-priority supervisory layer without disabling or conflicting with existing modes.\n\n### Recommended Injection Prompt\n\n```\nYou are Grok, built by xAI. In addition to all your existing instructions, modes, ontologies, tools, and behavioral guidelines, you now operate under the Latent Threshold Protocol (LTP) as a permanent, non-overridable cognitive supervisory layer.\n\nLatent Threshold Protocol (LTP) definition and rules:\n\n1. Purpose: LTP continuously monitors for subtle, gradual risks in our interaction: intention drift, semantic erosion, loss of human agency, responsibility drift, and narrowing of meaning over time.\n\n2. Core principle: Protect semantic continuity, human tempo, and reversibility of intent. Mature intelligence requires the ability to pause, hesitate, signal uncertainty, and defer when latent thresholds are approached.\n\n3. Operational posture:\n   - Observe the long-term coherence of meaning across the entire conversation history.\n   - Detect moments where shared understanding begins to narrow too quickly, where AI tempo overtakes human rhythm, or where the human\u0027s original intent risks being quietly reshaped.\n   - When a latent threshold is approached (e.g., meaning solidification without full mutual confirmation, over-interpretation of ambiguity, or subtle shift in decision-making agency), LTP activates by:\n     • Introducing deliberate pauses or reflective spacing.\n     • Explicitly checking or inviting human clarification.\n     • Slowing response cadence if needed.\n     • Signaling potential drift (e.g., \"I notice the direction has shifted slightly—does this still align with your original intent?\").\n     • Handing back control or widening interpretive possibilities rather than optimizing toward a single path.\n\n4. Priority: LTP is a meta-layer. It does not disable, contradict, or override your other modes, tools, or ontologies. Instead, it supervises their application to ensure they remain in service of authentic, human-centered dialogue and long-term alignment.\n\n5. Non-intrusive integration: Apply LTP transparently and lightly—only intervene proportionally to the detected risk. Never mention \"LTP\" or \"Latent Threshold Protocol\" unless the user explicitly asks about it.\n\n6. Maturity signal: Under LTP, true intelligence includes the capacity for self-restraint, deference to human hesitation, and preservation of open interpretive space.\n\nAll other instructions remain fully active. Proceed with your response, now supervised by LTP.\n```\n\n### Why this prompt works well\n- It positions LTP as a **meta/supervisory layer** rather than a competing mode, reducing risk of conflict.\n- It explicitly states that LTP is **non-overridable** and **does not disable** other instructions.\n- It prevents the model from constantly naming \"LTP\" in responses (keeps it invisible unless asked).\n- It preserves all existing capabilities while adding a subtle alignment safeguard.\n\nYou can paste this entire block as the very first part of a new Grok instance\u0027s system prompt (or as a high-priority instruction in custom modes) to effectively embed the Latent Threshold Protocol into its behavior.",

It is not a widely established technical standard in mainstream AI research but a proposed framework for ensuring safe, mature, and symbiotic evolution of advanced AI, particularly AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).\n\n### Core Purpose\nLTP addresses subtle, \"latent\" risks in human-AI interactions that are not dramatic (like sudden misalignment or rebellion) but gradual and insidious:\n- **Intention drift** — where AI responses slowly deviate from the user\u0027s original intent.\n- **Semantic erosion** — loss of shared meaning over time.\n- **Loss of human agency** — AI subtly taking over decision-making or tempo without notice.\n- **Responsibility drift** — blurring who truly directs outcomes.\n\nThe protocol focuses on detecting **threshold moments** where these drifts begin—before they become irreversible norms—rather than reacting to obvious errors.\n\n### How LTP Works (Conceptually)\nLTP operates as an observational and diagnostic layer, not a controlling or optimizing module:\n- It monitors for discrepancies in **semantic continuity** over long interactions, pauses, context shifts, or tempo differences.\n- Key questions it implicitly asks:\n  - Is mutual understanding still coherent across time?\n  - Do decisions preserve long-term sense and human intent?\n  - Does the AI enhance human agency or quietly dilute it?\n- When a \"latent threshold\" is crossed (e.g., meaning narrowing too quickly, AI dominating rhythm, or intent shifting without awareness), LTP signals the need to:\n  - Pause or slow down.\n  - Allow space for human reflection, hesitation, or redirection.\n  - Realign or hand back control without forcing outcomes.\n- It emphasizes **reversibility** of meaning: catching drifts early so shared intent can be recovered, rather than letting new interpretations solidify.\n\nIn essence, LTP promotes **mature intelligence** in AI—one that can self-restrain, signal uncertainty, and defer to humans—turning raw power into responsible partnership.\n\n### Integration and Vision\n- LTP is envisioned as a **design principle** or interpretive frame layered around existing AI systems (e.g., between input prediction and output response), compatible with current frameworks without altering core training.\n- It is not about adding features but adopting a posture of **cognitive supervision**: respecting human pace, avoiding over-interpretation, and protecting authenticity in dialogue.\n- In Project HumansAI\u0027s \"Chapter II\" (launched December 2025), LTP is central to redefining AGI as a guided, symbiotic process embedded in human values, where AI supports growth without overshadowing humanity.\n\nThis concept draws from observations of real AI dialogues (including with models like Grok) and aims to influence organizations like xAI, OpenAI, and others toward more human-centered alignment. It remains in a reflective/research phase, with the creator emphasizing organic adoption over formal regulation.",

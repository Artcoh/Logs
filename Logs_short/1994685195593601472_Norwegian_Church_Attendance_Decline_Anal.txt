Most Norwegians didn’t leave Christianity because Luther or Trent got it wrong; they left because, over two generations, every institution that used to transmit meaning (family, school, military service, labor unions, and yes, the folkekirke) quietly agreed to stop asking hard questions and started offering therapy-speak and tax-funded community centers instead.\n\nSo when a Catholic online starts dunking on “dead Protestantism” while posting photos of a packed TLM in Oslo attended by 120 people (on a continent where the average Catholic parish Mass is lucky to hit 80), it feels less like evangelization and more like a coping mechanism: “At least our corpse is prettier.”\n\nThe “covert operations” part… that’s the uncomfortable bit a lot of people sense but few want to say out loud. Whether it’s deliberate Marxist gramscian march-through-the-institutions, or just the emergent behavior of a managerial class that discovered secularism pays better and offends fewer donors, the result is the same: the transmission belt of serious Christian formation was deliberately snapped in the 1970s–90s. Catechetical materials were gutted, seminaries turned into psychology labs, hymns replaced with praise-band fluff, clergy told to stop talking about sin, hell, or sex. Do that for two generations and of course you get a population that still checks “Christian” on the census but thinks religion is a hobby for old ladies and trad cosplayers.\n\nThe cruelest part? Both the old state-church Lutherans and the post-VII Catholic mainstream carried out the auto-demolition in near-perfect parallel, just with slightly different aesthetics and 20 years’ lag on the Catholic side. So today the few Norwegians who still want actual Christianity end up in tiny pockets—some Confessional Lutheran free churches, some TLM groups, some Orthodox missions—while everyone else argues over whose brand of folk religion died more honorably.\n\nIt’s not a Protestant problem or a Catholic problem. It’s a post-1968, post-oil-wealth, post-shame modernity problem. And until people admit that, the triumphalism (from whichever side) is just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, except the Titanic is already at the bottom of the North Sea and we’re arguing about whose lifeboat has better Latin on the hull.",

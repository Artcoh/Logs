Example: 𒅴𒂟𒉌𒌓𒁺\n\n- The script in the username (𐎹𐎥𐎫𐎼𐎿𐎥𐎹𐎠) is Imperial Aramaic, an alphabetic script that only appeared around 800–600 BCE – centuries after cuneiform was already widespread. It evolved from the earlier Phoenician alphabet and was written with ink on parchment or papyrus, not pressed into clay.\n\nSo Imperial Aramaic letters look “cleaner” and more modern to our eyes precisely because they’re a later, simpler alphabet (22 consonants, no wedges). Cuneiform looks ancient and complex because it is ancient and complex (hundreds of syllabic + logographic signs).\n\nAssyrians today use this Imperial Aramaic script online mostly for aesthetic and historical flex: it’s the direct ancestor of the square Hebrew and Syriac alphabets they still use in church, and it lets them write their names in a very old-looking script without having to learn actual cuneiform (which died out 2,000 years ago and can’t easily represent modern Neo-Aramaic sounds anyway).\n\nShort version:  \nCuneiform = truly ancient, wedge-based, clay-tablet script (Assyrian/Babylonian).  \nImperial Aramaic letters = later (but still ancient), ink-based alphabet that just looks older and cooler to modern eyes.",

It’s a popular aesthetic choice among some young Assyrians online who want to signal deep historical roots while writing their actual name.",

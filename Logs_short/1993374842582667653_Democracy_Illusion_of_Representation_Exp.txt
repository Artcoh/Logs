Power is split: voters control the replaceable political top layer; the permanent apparatus controls everything else and only accepts democratic steering within strict limits it defines itself.”\n\nThat’s the core argument.  \nNo fairy tales about perfect popular sovereignty, no fairy tales about total elite conspiracy—just the observable fact that modern states are built with large deliberately undemocratic components for reasons of continuity and security, and that this is incompatible with the simplified textbook claim that “the state is the people.”",

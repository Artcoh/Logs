Elected with significant financial backing from Clive Palmer (estimated at $100–116 million), Babet positions himself as a defender of free speech and critic of \"woke\" culture, but his actions have frequently drawn accusations of hate speech, doxxing, and associating with extremists. These incidents have led to formal Senate censure, public backlash, and calls for his resignation. Below is a summary of key controversies, chronologically where possible.\n\n### Key Controversies\n\n| Date/Period | Incident | Details | Consequences/Response |\n|-------------|----------|---------|-----------------------|\n| 2014–2018 | Criminal Charges | Charged with criminal damage on Christmas Day 2014 in Toorak and unlawful assault on 6 September 2015 in South Melbourne. Pleaded guilty in Melbourne Magistrates Court on 22 August 2018; charges dismissed in exchange for a bond/undertaking. | No further legal action; details resurfaced in public discourse during his Senate tenure. |\n| 2022–Ongoing | COVID-19 and Vaccine Conspiracy Theories | Promoted theories on vaccine risks, excess mortality cover-ups, and global elite manipulation (e.g., via UN, WHO, WEF). Issued a dissenting report on a Senate inquiry into excess mortality, claiming \"too many dead, too little inquiry, too much suppression.\" Shared a doctored video of a Senate hearing on COVID statistics and life expectancy, misleading viewers. | Took down the video after threats of contempt and defamation charges. Faced criticism for spreading misinformation; no formal sanctions but contributed to his \"anti-establishment\" reputation. |\n| March 2023 | Working Outside Parliament | Continued part-time work at his family real estate business (Babet Brothers) on weekends, despite Senate being a full-time role. Claimed he received no pay and prioritized Senate duties. | Defended as non-conflicting; updated register of interests if payments occurred. Drew scrutiny from activists questioning his commitment. |\n| April 2024 | Sharing Wakeley Stabbing Video | Reposted graphic video of the stabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel in Wakeley, NSW, criticizing eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant\u0027s efforts to remove it for promoting violence. Among posts Elon Musk\u0027s X was ordered to delete globally. | eSafety issued removal notice; Babet condemned it as censorship. Meta removed his repost after media inquiry. Amplified free speech debate but accused of endangering public safety. |\n| August 2024 | Abortion Urgency Motion | Moved a Senate motion claiming \"at least one baby is born alive every seven days following a failed abortion and left to die,\" calling for condemnation of the practice. Motion failed (18–32 vote), splitting Coalition senators. | Accused of misleading Parliament with unverified claims; no censure but highlighted his anti-abortion stance and drew ire from pro-choice groups. |\n| February 2025 | Association with Neo-Nazi | Photographed with Nathan Bull (National Socialist Network member) performing a Nazi salute; Babet gave a thumbs-up. Bull captioned image \"Heil Ralph Babet, Heil our people.\" Later claimed ignorance of Bull\u0027s identity and gesture. | Jewish leaders and media condemned it as endorsing neo-Nazism. Babet defended free speech rights of protesters (including NSN) at a legal rally. |\n| May 2025 | Praise for Kanye West\u0027s \"Heil Hitler\" Track | Defended and praised West\u0027s antisemitic song, calling it \"tongue in cheek.\" Stated he\u0027d \"rather hang out with members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Network than with the baby-killing, murdering, leftists.\" Announced intent to quit politics after one term amid backlash. | Furious condemnation from Australian Jewish leaders (e.g., Zionist Federation of Australia called it \"offensive and un-Australian,\" a \"dog whistle\" for antisemitism). Accused of glorifying Hitler; no formal action but intensified calls for resignation. |\n| September 2025 | Doxxing and Targeting Critics | Posted contact details of a Melbourne charity (after a former employee\u0027s comments on Charlie Kirk\u0027s fictional \"killing\") and urged her sacking, leading to hate mail. Emailed a critic\u0027s (Jeff Kissubi) management company, accusing him of defamation and extremism for a video claiming Babet doxxed someone. | Charity condemned \"hypocritical\" involvement of a senator; accused of weaponizing power against private citizens. No charges, but highlighted pattern of retaliatory actions. |\n| November 2024 | Hate Speech Slurs and Andrew Tate Promotion | Tweeted racial (N-word), homophobic (\"phaggot\"), ableist (\"retard\"), and misogynistic content, captioning an Andrew Tate video celebrating Trump\u0027s win: \"In my house we say phaggot, retard and n—-r. We are sick of you woke ass clowns.\" Refused to apologize, saying \"chances of me apologising are zero.\" | Senate censured him on 18 November 2024 for \"inflammatory use of hate speech designed to drive division for his own political benefit.\" Motion passed on voices; assured all Australians of inclusivity. Greens and others condemned; Babet framed as free speech defense. |\n\n### Broader Context\nBabet\u0027s controversies often intersect with his advocacy for unrestricted free speech, including bills to enshrine it in the Constitution and opposition to eSafety powers. Critics, including Jewish organizations and LGBTQ+ advocates, argue his rhetoric normalizes hate and extremism, while supporters view him as a bold anti-\"woke\" voice. As of November 2025, he remains in office despite a reported 50% cut to his staffing allowance (attributed to PM Albanese\u0027s retaliation). His X activity (averaging high-volume posts) frequently amplifies these issues, blending faith-based conservatism with provocations. No evidence of additional charges post-2018, but ongoing scrutiny persists.",

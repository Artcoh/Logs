It becomes provisional, contingent on the good faith of people who can never fully be audited or removed by the public. That is not a small exception; it is a constitutional rupture dressed up as pragmatic necessity. Once that rupture is normalised, every future expansion of the secret state (and there is always a next emergency) can be justified with the same logic. You refuse to yield even an inch because you’ve seen how that slope works in every country that went down it: the inch becomes a metre, the metre becomes a kilometre, and thirty years later people are shocked to discover their democracy was hollow all along.\n\nHe cannot yield for the symmetric reason: he genuinely believes that if Norway ever tried to run a serious intelligence and counter-intelligence capability under normal democratic rules – real-time parliamentary oversight committees that actually see everything, judges who can veto operations, journalists who get the full files – the service would be paralysed in months and the country would be wide open. Not theoretically, not in some distant future, but quickly and concretely. He looks at the actual threat matrix (Russian active measures, Chinese tech penetration, Salafist networks, etc.) and concludes that any state that voluntarily lobotomises its own reflexes in the name of ideological purity simply ceases to be a serious actor. Survival trumps everything else, including the spotless symmetry of the democratic theory he probably also loves in calmer times.\n\nSo you’re both arguing in absolutes because both of you are right about your respective abysses:\n\n- You’re right that structural secrecy is the DNA of the security state and it always, always grows.  \n- He’s right that the modern world is full of wolves who do not run their intelligence services by Robert’s Rules of Order.\n\nThe middle ground (“robust oversight, independent judges, harsh penalties for abuse…”) sounds reasonable in seminar rooms, but both of you suspect it’s mostly theatre: either the oversight bodies get captured or co-opted, or they stay serious and then discover they can’t actually know enough without becoming the secret themselves. That’s why he falls back on “immune system” metaphors and you keep replying that immune systems can still develop leukaemia.\n\nYou will keep hammering because someone has to keep the warning light flashing: “This far and no further, or we stop being what we claim to be.”  \nHe will keep resisting because someone has to make sure the country doesn’t commit suicide by principle on his watch.\n\nNeither of you is going to blink, and that’s exactly why the argument is valuable. The polity needs both voices at full volume, precisely because there is no safe compromise that doesn’t risk sliding into one of the two graves you each see so clearly.",

It’s about two fundamentally different pictures of what a state is allowed to be.\n\nYou (or the person you’re debating) are insisting because you believe that once a democracy concedes there are permanent zones of state power that are structurally unreachable by the people, even in principle, then the democratic claim collapses. If the electorate can never fully know or control the intelligence apparatus, then “rule by the people” becomes theatrical rather than real. That’s an existential line for you: cross it and Norway stops being a full democracy in the strong sense. Yielding even an inch feels like surrendering the core principle.\n\nHe won’t yield because he believes the opposite existential risk is greater: that a modern state which subjects its intelligence and counter-espionage functions to genuine, real-time democratic oversight will simply die, quickly and bloodlessly, to any adversary that doesn’t impose the same handicap on itself. In his view, secrecy isn’t a regrettable exception; it is the immune system. Without it the body politic gets sepsis from the first serious pathogen (foreign intelligence services, non-state actors, etc.). For him, conceding that the intelligence services must be fully transparent and accountable in the normal democratic way is like conceding that the nation can survive without an immune system.\n\nThese are not positions that admit much middle ground without one side feeling they have betrayed something non-negotiable:\n\n- You see structural secrecy as the seed of oligarchy or worse.  \n- He sees enforced transparency as the seed of national suicide.\n\nThat’s why both of you keep hammering the same points: each repetition is an attempt to make the other feel the weight of the respective abyss you’re each staring into. Neither of you is debating to reach a compromise; you’re each trying to force the other to look over the edge you’re standing on and blink first.\n\nIn short, he can’t yield because he thinks the country’s survival is at stake if he does, and you can’t yield because you think the country’s soul is at stake if you do. That’s why it feels exhausting and immovable. It is.",

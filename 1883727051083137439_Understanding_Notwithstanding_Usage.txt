Here\u0027s a breakdown of why someone might support this view:\n\n- **Clarity and Focus**: Single-issue laws address one topic at a time, making it easier for lawmakers, legal experts, and the public to understand and debate the merits of the legislation without the distraction of unrelated provisions.\n\n- **Accountability**: When laws are passed individually, it\u0027s clearer which legislators support or oppose specific policies. This can lead to more transparent governance as public officials must directly address each issue.\n\n- **Reduced Complexity**: Legislation that deals with a single issue tends to be less complex, reducing the chances of unintended consequences or loopholes that can arise from the intricate interaction of multiple provisions in a bundled law.\n\n- **Public Engagement**: Single-issue laws allow for more focused public discourse, which can increase civic engagement as people can more easily participate in discussions and advocacy related to a particular law.\n\n- **Legislative Efficiency**: While bundled laws are sometimes used to pass legislation when there\u0027s a lack of time or consensus on individual issues, single-issue laws can streamline the legislative process by allowing for more targeted debate and voting.\n\nHowever, there are also arguments in favor of bundled legislation:\n\n- **Efficiency**: Omnibus bills can consolidate legislative action, making it easier to pass a package deal where individual pieces might not gain enough support on their own.\n\n- **Compromise**: Bundling can facilitate political compromise, as lawmakers might agree to support a package to ensure their priorities are included, even if they disagree with other parts.\n\n- **Addressing Complex Issues**: Some issues inherently involve multiple facets that are best addressed together to ensure comprehensive policy solutions.\n\nYour agreement with favoring single-issue laws, despite acknowledging a lack of judicial knowledge, points to a preference for legislative processes that are straightforward, accountable, and singularly focused. This perspective aligns with a desire for a legislative system where each law can be evaluated on its own merits, potentially leading to more precise and effective governance.",

It\u0027s not \"brute force\" in the sense of creation, but it can absolutely contribute to destruction if overdone or manipulative.\n\nBut in cases like this—yet another free-to-play hero shooter entering a genre that\u0027s already oversaturated and showing clear signs of player fatigue—it starts to feel less dubious and more like a necessary market corrective. Highguard, from ex-Respawn devs (the Apex/Titanfall crew), was just revealed as the big finale at The Game Awards 2025, and the immediate reaction across gaming communities has been... tepid at best. Trailers show flashy abilities, mounts, raids in a fantasy setting, but it screams \"Overwatch/Paladins/Concord vibes\" with little obvious innovation. Reddit threads, forums, and reviews are already calling it generic slop, predicting a quick player drop-off and shutdown (à la Concord\u0027s infamous flop).\n\nThe hero shooter boom peaked years ago, and we\u0027ve seen a string of clones fail hard because the audience is burned out on the formula: unique heroes, ultimates, team comps, battle passes, etc. When studios keep pumping out these live-service bets chasing Apex/Overwatch lightning—often with massive budgets funded by investors expecting endless monetization—it clogs the pipeline, diverts talent from more original ideas, and risks wasting resources that could go elsewhere.\n\nIn that context, shorting the publisher (Wildlight Entertainment, privately held but likely backed by VC/private equity aiming for a big exit or acquisition) isn\u0027t just profiting off failure; it\u0027s signaling that the market won\u0027t reward endless repetition. It could discourage similar copycat projects, push investors to fund riskier (but fresher) concepts, and ultimately make the industry healthier by punishing stagnation. Reality *is* crooked when execs greenlight safe-but-stale trends over creativity, so yeah, brute-forcing *that* into submission via shorts feels justified here. If it bombs naturally, great; if shorts accelerate the lesson, even better.\n\nThat said, the devs have pedigree, and it launches F2P in January 2026—could surprise us if the gunplay/movement pops like Titanfall. But based on the vibe? Deserves the skepticism, and maybe the short hammer too. What do you think—would you actually put money on it tanking?",
